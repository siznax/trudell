Song by John Trudell and Robbie Robertson

"When we leave as humans we go back to being. Being human being that
really means something. But we live in a reality now in a time,
where. I would say to anyone ya know, protect your spirit. Protect
your spirit, because. Because you're in the place where spirits get
eaten." -John Trudell

From The Pines "Above The Prairie" - http://www.thepinesmusic.com/

We wish to honor the spirit and legacy of John Trudell for future
generations to come.  The Pines would like to thank Faye Brown, Missy
Whiteman, and all of John's family & loved ones.

"Time Dreams" was born from the collaboration between John Trudell &
The Pines, words & music, as the last track from the 2016 record
"Above The Prairie".

The “Time Dreams” video is a collaboration between The Pines and
writer, director and producer Missy Whiteman of Independent Indigenous
Film and Media. Whiteman, of the Northern Arapaho and Kickapoo
Nations, is a director and digital media consultant who’s currently
working on a sci-fi/docu-narritive short film titled The Coyote Way:
Going Back Home. Footage from this project appears in the video, along
with clips from the incendiary 2005 documentary Trudell, produced and
directed by Heather Rae. Jonathan Thunder contributes animation to the
video, which also features a special appearance by Missy’s son Louis
Whiteman representing the younger generation’s connection to Trudell’s
message. Louis signs the words “Friend, Together and Peace in Plains
American Indian Sign Language, a rare and ancient Indigenous form of
communication.

John Trudell was one of the leaders for the Indian of All Tribes
Occupation of Alcatraz in 1969, ran Radio Free Alcatraz, and went on
to serve as Chairman of the American Indian Movement (AIM) from
1973-1979. On February 11, 1979, he burned an American flag on the
steps of the F.B.I J. Edgar Hoover building in Washington D.C.,
explaining that he had been taught in the military to burn the flag
once it had been desecrated; and that the US government’s treatment of
Native Americans, and the country’s classism and racism had desecrated
the flag. About 12 hours after the flag incident, in the early morning
of Abraham Lincoln’s birthday, a fire “of suspicious origin” burned
down Trudell’s home on the Shoshone Palute reservation in Nevada,
killing Trudell’s pregnant wife, Tina, their three children and Tina’s
mother. The F.B.I. declined to investigate, and the blaze was
officially ruled an “accident.” 

He turned his tears into writing poetry and later, music and
acting. He released several volumes of poetry and appearing in such
films as Thunderheart and Smoke Signals. He also recorded several
highly regarded albums combining spoken word and music. A lifelong
activist and human rights advocate, he was quoted as saying “I’m just
a human being trying to make it in a world that is rapidly losing its
understanding of being human.”

Whiteman says, “‘Time Dreams’ honors the life and legacy of John
Trudell in a way that speaks to the hearts of all people.”

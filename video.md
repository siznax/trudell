Whiteclay, Nebraska is a tiny unincorporated town that sits on the
border with South Dakota. Until its closure by state officials, its
four liquor stores sold more than 4m cans of beer a year, almost
entirely to members of Lakota Sioux tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian
reservation, where the sale of alcohol is banned. The Guardian spent
time on the reservation to understand the impact of alcohol on its
residents – and the activists and Lakota tribe members determined to
keep the town closed

_This is Indian Relay, North America's original extreme sport_

Welcome to the dangerous, high-stakes world of Indian Relay — North

### Sundance Winner | _Fast Horse_

Winner of the Short Film Special Jury Award for Directing at Sundance
2019: Alexandra Lazarowich

Take an intimate verité visit to a fascinating and little-known world:
the dangerous and high-stakes game of Indian Relay.

In Blackfoot country, they call Indian Relay “North America’s original
extreme sport.” Jockeys bareback gallop their horses around a track,
jumping off one and on to another in a chaotic melee of horses and
handlers at “the exchange”. Accidents happen. Simply finishing a race
demands masterful skill and courage.

Siksika horseman Allison RedCrow dreams of bringing a team to the
“greatest outdoor show on Earth” – the Calgary Stampede – so he and
his people can show the world their unparalleled skill on horseback.  

Our cameras follow Allison and his new jockey, Cody BigTobacco, over
the course of a year as they assemble a team of horses, train them for
the relay race and finally make their debut at the Calgary Stampede.
Their team, Old Sun, will face the best riders in the Blackfoot
Confederacy, many of them veteran competitors from Montana. Fast Horse
puts the audience on the back of a galloping horse, an exhilarating
POV experience that captures the thrill and risk of this white-knuckle
sport. 

But our cameras also capture the touching bond Cody and Allison have
with their horses. Witness, with intimate proximity, the committed
effort these majestic animals demand from their riders and
handlers. We see the horses accept their role and learn the complex
movements of the race.

And through this process, we come to understand and respect the skills
of horsemanship, which have been passed down for generations and
remain intact.

With a heart-pumping climax, experience the final race at the Calgary
Stampede from Cody’s own perspective. And just as promised, learn just
how unpredictable and dangerous the Indian Relay can be.

30 million, this iconic animal has recently come dangerously close to
extinction. By 1900, extensive hunting and fur trading had reduced
their population to less than one thousand. Although much progress has
been made over the past century, conservationists are still working
diligently to bring back the magnificent beast of the plains.

### Life Lakota: The Cheyenne River Reservation

2019 · Short Documentary · 15m

Life Lakota captures the state of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation
in South Dakota today. The Lakota culture is fading and their voices
must be heard. Local leaders are taking action to educate the youth
while organizations like the Sioux YMCA are helping kids stay above
the influence of many of the extreme adversities that the reservation
presents them. Lakota people are humble, proud and full of faith, we
are honored to help tell their story.

Notes:

1. About 75% of the tribe is living in poverty
1. County has highest percent of impoverished children in the U.S.
1. There are 3-7 suicide attempts each week
1. Federal recognition of a tribe requires three criteria be met:
    * a language (prohibited from 1890-1990)
    * a culture (religious practices prohibited from 1890-1978)
    * a land base
1. Orville Lookinghorse, keeper of the sacred calf pipe holds prophecy
   of the seventh generation, the current one, being the last hope of
   the Lakota people
1. Tom Reeves (Enemies Sing of Him) Sung Watogala wild horses Youth
   Program. "Rodeo used to be a right of passage on the
   reservations. We're trying to bring it back."
1. "That bird over there. The fish in the water. We're all
    related. Everything in the universe is related."
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitakuye_Oyasin
    spoken by Lakota teacher (possible Orville Red Bear)
1. Irona Howe, **"You can focus on that bad things here, but the youth
   here are good. Don't over analyze the alcoholism. We're not
   hopeless. We're not helpless. We have those sprits here, and they
   are strong, but they are everywhere. Don't come here looking for
   the broken down houses. We are not pitiful. We are strong people,
   very strong, and we'll rise."**
1. The Sioux YMCA takes in 2,500 kids each year. Their work saves
   lives. 

_Take kindly the council of the earth gracefully surrounding the
thing of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden
misfortunes but do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears
are born in fatigue and loneliness beyond the wholesome discipline. Be
gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the
trees and the stars. You have a right to be here. And whether or not
it's clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Be
at peace with god, whatever you conceive him to be. And whatever your
labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life. Keep peace
with your soul. With all the sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is
still a beautiful world. Be cheerful, and strive to be happy._

challenges for Lakota on the reservation.

For nearly a hundred years, it was illegal to practice Lakota

future—and they’re using their Lakota heritage to get there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie4m9LAVDGw

For a hundred years, it was virtually illegal to be Lakota. The Native
American tribe, known for its chiefs Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and
Red Cloud, was legally dispossessed of its religion, its spiritual
practices, and much of its language, starting in the late 19th
century. All Native American tribes were. Until 1978 and the passage
of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, generations of Lakota
were raised without access to their culture.Now, the Cheyenne River
Youth Project is working with a determined generation of young Lakota
to create a stronger economic and cultural future—and they’re using
their Lakota heritage to get there.

### PBS Matters of Race: We're Still Here

2003 · Roja Productions · 1h

https://www.pbs.org/mattersofrace/prog3.shtml

The third program is a contemporary look at two communities often
overlooked in the race dialogue: American Indians and Native
Hawaiians. On the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, the program
features the voices of three generations of Lakota families as they
consider their past, their future and the process of merging multiple
world views, ways of life, and ideas of America. Through the stories
of these families the film considers the historical construction of
Indian "otherness" and its influence on the ways a new generation of
Lakota people will address issues of unemployment, alcohol, domestic
abuse, and apathy ravaging their community. Meanwhile, across the
Pacific Ocean, beginning in the late 1990s, lawsuit after lawsuit
challenged the rights of Native Hawaiians to run schools and housing
programs that provided only for their beleaguered community. Having
been accused of reverse-racism, how do they see themselves in relation
to the rest of the nation? And what are their connections to other
Native communities? These are the questions explored in this film,
which is directed by Sindi Gordon.

_A Journey through the Eight-Part Documentary Series_

https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/

#### Episode One (To 1806)

The West begins as the whole world to the people who live there. It
becomes a New World when Europeans arrive, a world shaken by
incompatible visions. And almost three centuries later, when Lewis and
Clark venture west to find a Northwest Passage, this world becomes the
testing-ground for a young nation's continent-spanning dream.

* Introduction
* When Dogs Could Talk
* The Vision
* Cities of Gold
* Thunder Rolling from the Mountains
* Popé
* Dog Soldiers
* In the Garden, Before the Fall
* Corps of Discovery
* The People

#### Episode Two (1806 to 1848)

Americans head west along many pathways -- following the fur trade
into the mountains, fighting for self-determination in Texas, seeking
religious freedom in Utah or a better life along the Oregon Trail. But
whatever direction they travel, they move closer with every step to a
“Manifest Destiny” that will make the West their own.

* Introduction
* Hats
* The Heart of Everything
* Tejas
* In the Midst of Savage Darkness
* We go to conquer
* Trail of Tears
* The Barren Rock
* Westward I Go Free
* What A Country
* So We Die
* A Continental Nation
* Empire Upon the Trails

### Episode Three (1848 to 1856)

The Gold Rush brings the whole world to the West, as 49ers from Asia,
South America and the eastern states scramble for “a share of the
rocks,” littering the hills with mining towns and creating the West’s
first metropolis. But in the push to strike it rich, many are
violently pushed aside.

* Introduction
* Gold Fever
* My Share of the Rocks
* Kit
* Stay at Home
* The Diggings
* The Right of Conquest
* This Land of Gold & Hope
* Emporium of the Pacific
* Diggers
* The Day of Forty-nine
* Speck of the Future

#### Episode Four (1856 to 1868)

Civil war comes early to the West. In “Bleeding Kansas,” abolitionists
battle for free soil. In Utah, federal troops march against Mormon
polygamy. And along the Rio Grande, oppressed Mexican Americans
rebel. The war between North and South unleashes brute savagery in the
West, and leaves behind an army prepared for total war against the
native peoples of the plains.

* Introduction
* Free Soil
* Mountain meadows
* The Republic of the Rio Grande
* This Guilty Land
* Anarchy
* Preachers and Jackass Rabbits
* Who is the Savage?
* The Everywhere Spirit
* Death Runs Riot

#### Episode Five (1868 to 1874)

A triumph of the human spirit, the transcontinental railroad opens a
new era in the West, carrying homesteaders onto the prairies, bringing
cowboys up the cattle trail from Texas, helping give women the vote in
Utah and sending buffalo hunters onto the plains, where they drive a
symbol of the West -- and a way of life -- to the brink of extinction.

* Introduction
* A Grand Anvil Chorus
* White Man's Pipe
* The Artillery of Heaven
* An Instinct for Direction
* One People
* The Woman's Exponent
* Walking Gold Pieces
* Good Company
* How do you like Nebraska?
* Cowboys
* A Wound in the Heart
* The Grandest Enterprise Under God

#### Episode Six (1874 to 1877)

The federal government tightens its grip on the West, but three bold
spirits remain defiant -- Sitting Bull, who prophesies his people's
greatest victory but cannot prevent their ultimate defeat; Brigham
Young, who must sacrifice a spiritual son to save his church; and
Chief Joseph, who triumphs in defeat as an indomitable voice of
conscience for the West.

* Introduction
* Yellow Hair
* Tatanka-Iyotanka
* Hard Times
* A Good Day to Die
* Center My Heart
* Good Words
* Fight No More Forever

#### Episode Seven (1877 to 1887)

Newcomers arrive by the millions, bringing a new spirit of conformity
to the West. Indian children are taught to forsake their heritage,
Mormons are told to abandon a tenet of their faith, and new laws deny
Chinese and Mexican Americans a place in society. Yet the legend of
the “Wild West” lives on, thanks to the greatest showman of the age.

* Introduction
* The Exodusters
* Rain Follows the Plow
* A Hard Time I Have
* Barbarians
* The Romance of My Life
* The Barrio
* I Must Lose Myself Again
* Friends of the Indian
* Medicine Flower
* Hell Without the Heat
* Gunpowder Entertainment
* Final Vision
* The Geography of Hope

#### Episode Eight (1887 to 1914)

As settlers race to claim tribal lands, Native Americans take up the
Ghost Dance, trusting in its power to restore a lost way of life until
their hopes are crushed at Wounded Knee. The new century marks a new
era in the West, an age of aqueducts and smelters. But the West
remains what it has always been, a world waiting for a dream.

* Introduction
* Guthrie
* The Outcome of Our Ernest Endeavors
* Butte
* Like Grass Before the Sickle
* P.S I Like You Very Much
* Progress
* Take It
* Lachryma Montis
* This Isn't History
* To Speak for My People
* I Will Never Leave You
* The Gift
* One Sky Above Us

### John Trudell Spoken Word Tour 1994

2017 · Matthew Lippincott · 2h 2m

This previously unseen video is from the John Trudell 1994 Spoken Word
Tour at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA. Also appearing are
Margaret Palmer, Johnny Jackson and LeRoy Mills. I (Dr. Matthew
Lippincott) was asked to video the event by one of the organizer,
Randy Ash. On more than one occasion I spent time with John Trudell,
and, as many others would also report, found him to be humble,
insightful and sincere. Following his death I wanted to put this video
online as a form of tribute to such a rare and influential person. I
converted the video (original source is SVHS) recently and have been
able to improve the quality, although it still doesn't look very good
in full screen. Anyone viewing this who knows the names of other
people who appear can contact me via my linkedIn account:
https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redi... so I can add that
information.

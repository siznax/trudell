"_Mitákuye Oyás’iŋ_. That means all my relatives. That bird over there. The fish in the water. We're all related. Everything in the universe is related." —Lakota teacher (2019)

### Life Lakota: The Cheyenne River Reservation

2019 · Short Documentary · 15m

Life Lakota captures the state of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation
in South Dakota today. The Lakota culture is fading and their voices
must be heard. Local leaders are taking action to educate the youth
while organizations like the Sioux YMCA are helping kids stay above
the influence of many of the extreme adversities that the reservation
presents them. Lakota people are humble, proud and full of faith, we
are honored to help tell their story.

Notes:

1. About 75% of the tribe is living in poverty
1. County has highest percent of impoverished children in the U.S.
1. There are 3-7 suicide attempts each week
1. Federal recognition of a tribe requires three criteria be met:
    * a language (prohibited from 1890-1990)
    * a culture (religious practices prohibited from 1890-1978)
    * a land base
1. Orville Lookinghorse, keeper of the sacred calf pipe holds prophecy
   of the seventh generation, the current one, being the last hope of
   the Lakota people
1. Tom Reeves (Enemies Sing of Him) Sung Watogala wild horses Youth
   Program. "Rodeo used to be a right of passage on the
   reservations. We're trying to bring it back."
1. "That bird over there. The fish in the water. We're all
    related. Everything in the universe is related."
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitakuye_Oyasin
    spoken by Lakota teacher (possible Orville Red Bear)
1. Irona Howe, **"You can focus on that bad things here, but the youth
   here are good. Don't over analyze the alcoholism. We're not
   hopeless. We're not helpless. We have those sprits here, and they
   are strong, but they are everywhere. Don't come here looking for
   the broken down houses. We are not pitiful. We are strong people,
   very strong, and we'll rise."**
1. The Sioux YMCA takes in 2,500 kids each year. Their work saves
   lives. 

_Take kindly the council of the earth gracefully surrounding the
thing of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden
misfortunes but do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears
are born in fatigue and loneliness beyond the wholesome discipline. Be
gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the
trees and the stars. You have a right to be here. And whether or not
it's clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Be
at peace with god, whatever you conceive him to be. And whatever your
labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life. Keep peace
with your soul. With all the sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is
still a beautiful world. Be cheerful, and strive to be happy._
—[Max Ehrmann, 1920s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiderata)

### Lakota in America 

2017 · Short Film Documentary · 15m

Genevieve Iron Lightning is a young Lakota dancer on the Cheyenne
River Reservation, one of the poorest communities in the
US. Unemployment, addiction, alcoholism, and suicide are all
challenges for Lakota on the reservation.

For nearly a hundred years, it was illegal to practice Lakota
customs. Now, the Cheyenne River Youth Project is working with young
people like Genevieve to create a stronger economic and cultural
future—and they’re using their Lakota heritage to get there.

For a hundred years, it was virtually illegal to be Lakota. The Native
American tribe, known for its chiefs Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and
Red Cloud, was legally dispossessed of its religion, its spiritual
practices, and much of its language, starting in the late 19th
century. All Native American tribes were. Until 1978 and the passage
of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, generations of Lakota
were raised without access to their culture.Now, the Cheyenne River
Youth Project is working with a determined generation of young Lakota
to create a stronger economic and cultural future—and they’re using
their Lakota heritage to get there.

### Time Dreams (2016)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRTMe_EPgSM

From The Pines "Above The Prairie" - http://www.thepinesmusic.com/

We wish to honor the spirit and legacy of John Trudell for future
generations to come.  The Pines would like to thank Faye Brown, Missy
Whiteman, and all of John's family & loved ones.

"Time Dreams" was born from the collaboration between John Trudell &
The Pines, words & music, as the last track from the 2016 record
"Above The Prairie".

The “Time Dreams” video is a collaboration between The Pines and
writer, director and producer Missy Whiteman of Independent Indigenous
Film and Media. Whiteman, of the Northern Arapaho and Kickapoo
Nations, is a director and digital media consultant who’s currently
working on a sci-fi/docu-narritive short film titled The Coyote Way:
Going Back Home. Footage from this project appears in the video, along
with clips from the incendiary 2005 documentary Trudell, produced and
directed by Heather Rae. Jonathan Thunder contributes animation to the
video, which also features a special appearance by Missy’s son Louis
Whiteman representing the younger generation’s connection to Trudell’s
message. Louis signs the words “Friend, Together and Peace in Plains
American Indian Sign Language, a rare and ancient Indigenous form of
communication.

John Trudell was one of the leaders for the Indian of All Tribes
Occupation of Alcatraz in 1969, ran Radio Free Alcatraz, and went on
to serve as Chairman of the American Indian Movement (AIM) from
1973-1979. On February 11, 1979, he burned an American flag on the
steps of the F.B.I J. Edgar Hoover building in Washington D.C.,
explaining that he had been taught in the military to burn the flag
once it had been desecrated; and that the US government’s treatment of
Native Americans, and the country’s classism and racism had desecrated
the flag. About 12 hours after the flag incident, in the early morning
of Abraham Lincoln’s birthday, a fire “of suspicious origin” burned
down Trudell’s home on the Shoshone Palute reservation in Nevada,
killing Trudell’s pregnant wife, Tina, their three children and Tina’s
mother. The F.B.I. declined to investigate, and the blaze was
officially ruled an “accident.” 

He turned his tears into writing poetry and later, music and
acting. He released several volumes of poetry and appearing in such
films as Thunderheart and Smoke Signals. He also recorded several
highly regarded albums combining spoken word and music. A lifelong
activist and human rights advocate, he was quoted as saying “I’m just
a human being trying to make it in a world that is rapidly losing its
understanding of being human.”

Whiteman says, “‘Time Dreams’ honors the life and legacy of John
Trudell in a way that speaks to the hearts of all people.”

Russell Means gave this interview in Rapid City, SD. In this film
Russell is at his best - intelligent, aggressive, and unwilling to

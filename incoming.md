### 500 Years of Indigenous Resistance

by Gord Hill

2002

An alternative and unorthodox view of the colonization of the Americas
by Europeans is offered in this concise history. Eurocentric studies
of the conquest of the Americas present colonization as a civilizing
force for good, and the native populations as primitive or
worse. Colonization is seen as a mutually beneficial process, in which
"civilization” was brought to the natives who in return shared their
land and cultures. The opposing historical camp views colonization as
a form of genocide in which the native populations were passive
victims overwhelmed by European military power. In this fresh
examination, an activist and historian of native descent argues that
the colonial powers met resistance from the indigenous inhabitants and
that these confrontations shaped the forms and extent of
colonialism. This account encompasses North and South America, the
development of nation-states, and the resurgence of indigenous
resistance in the post-World War II era.

### Congressional Native American Caucus

The Congressional Native American Caucus is a bipartisan coalition of
lawmakers that work to advance our nation-to-nation relationships with
tribal governments and uphold our federal trust responsibilities to
Native Americans through the legislative process. The Caucus works on
a bipartisan basis to meet our nation’s moral and legal commitments to
American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians across a broad
range of policy areas, including but not limited to health, safety,
housing, education, economic development, and cultural
preservation. As outlined in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution,
the caucus works to protect tribal sovereignty.  

Members work to maintain close relationships with tribal nations and
their representatives, and amplify the voices of Native Americans in
policy debates across all issues. Members are connected with experts
and leaders within Indian Country such as the National Congress of
American Indians for information on legislative proposals that impact
Native American tribes.

### Great Law of Peace (and the U.S. Constitution)

Some historians, including Donald Grinde of the University at Buffalo,
The State University of New York, have claimed that the democratic
ideals of the Gayanashagowa provided a significant inspiration to
Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and other framers of the
U.S. Constitution. They contend that the federal structure of the
U.S. constitution was influenced by the living example of the Iroquois
confederation, as were notions of individual liberty and the
separation of powers. [more...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Law_of_Peace#Influence_on_the_United_States_Constitution)

### Hempstead Project Heart

Founded by legendary Native poet, philosopher and recording artist
John Trudell, Hempstead Project HEART is a vehicle to build public
awareness of the many benefits of growing Industrial Hemp. With a team
of committed volunteers at his side, notably Anna Owen, Linda Delair
and Lea Walters, John built Hempstead Project HEART to be a driving
force to grow the hemp economy in America. From speaking at public
events to organizing with the California State Grange on Industrial
Hemp advocacy, John and his Hempstead Project HEART team laid
important groundwork for public acceptance of hemp in California. In
November 2016, California re-legalized Industrial Hemp as a commercial
agricultural crop. This huge step demonstrates the importance of
education and action in creating positive
change. [more...](https://www.hempsteadprojectheart.org/our-story)

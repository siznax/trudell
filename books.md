There There (2018) _A Novel_ by Tommy Orange
https://www.google.com/books/edition/There_There/Dw83DwAAQBAJ

There There is a wondrous and shattering portrait of an America few
of us have ever seen. It’s “masterful . . . white-hot
. . . devastating” (The Washington Post) at the same time as it is
fierce, funny, suspenseful, thoroughly modern, and impossible to put
down. Here is a voice we have never heard—a voice full of poetry and
rage, exploding onto the page with urgency and force. Tommy Orange
has written a stunning novel that grapples with a complex and
painful history, with an inheritance of beauty and profound
spirituality, and with a plague of addiction, abuse, and
suicide. This is the book that everyone is talking about right now,
and it’s destined to be a classic.

_Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area_

by Malcolm Margolin

1978 · Heyday Books · 182pp

Two hundred years ago, herds of elk and antelope dotted the hills of
the San Francisco-Monterey Bay area. Grizzly bears lumbered down to
the creeks to fish for silver salmon and steelhead trout. From vast
marshlands geese, ducks, and other birds rose in thick clouds "with
a sound like that of a hurricane." This land of "inexpressible
fertility," as one early explorer described it, supported one of the
densest Indian populations in all of North America.

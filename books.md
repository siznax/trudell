Water for Life Poettree Publishings, Society of the People Struggling
to be Free, 1982. Jan Attridge, illustrator. Most likely a later
edition, printed by Common Weath Printing. Near Fine in wrappers.

The first book by this Sioux poet/activist, who was a founder and
National Chairman of the radical American Indian Movement during the
1970s; a turbulent time of Native American political activism. Trudell
became the spokesman for the Indians of All Tribes who occupied
Alcatraz Island, which led to the founding of AIM. He was the Chair of
AIM during the Wounded Knee siege and the Pine Ridge battle that left
two FBI agents and one Indian youth dead and resulted in Leonard
Peltier's conviction and incarceration for murder. Trudell's own
family, his wife and three children, were killed in a fire set by an
arsonist, which Trudell has long considered to have been an attempt to
strike back at him for his radical activism and militancy, including
his advocacy of the use of violence in pursuing claims of Native
rights. He appeared in the documentary film about Peltier, Incident at
Oglala, and was later cast as a charismatic Indian leader in the
fictionalized film version of that story, Thunderheart. He is a
musician as well as a poet and is also known as an eloquent speaker,
both as a political leader and, more recently, as a guest lecturer.

### _There, There_

by Tommy Orange

![There, There by Tommy Orange](images/orange-2018-there.jpg)

There There is a wondrous and shattering portrait of an America few
of us have ever seen. It’s “masterful . . . white-hot
. . . devastating” (The Washington Post) at the same time as it is
fierce, funny, suspenseful, thoroughly modern, and impossible to put
down. Here is a voice we have never heard—a voice full of poetry and
rage, exploding onto the page with urgency and force. Tommy Orange
has written a stunning novel that grapples with a complex and
painful history, with an inheritance of beauty and profound
spirituality, and with a plague of addiction, abuse, and
suicide. This is the book that everyone is talking about right now,
and it’s destined to be a classic.

_Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area_

![The Ohlone Way by Malcolm Margolin](margolin-1978-ohlone.jpg)

Two hundred years ago, herds of elk and antelope dotted the hills of
the San Francisco-Monterey Bay area. Grizzly bears lumbered down to
the creeks to fish for silver salmon and steelhead trout. From vast
marshlands geese, ducks, and other birds rose in thick clouds "with
a sound like that of a hurricane." This land of "inexpressible
fertility," as one early explorer described it, supported one of the
densest Indian populations in all of North America.

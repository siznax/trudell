The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee

_Native America From 1890 to the Present_

In The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, Treuer melds history with
reportage and memoir. Tracing the tribes' distinctive cultures from
first contact, he explores how the depredations of each era spawned
new modes of survival. The devastating seizures of land gave rise to
increasingly sophisticated legal and political maneuvering that put
the lie to the myth that Indians don't know or care about
property. The forced assimilation of their children at
government-run boarding schools incubated a unifying Native
identity. Conscription in the US military and the pull of urban life
brought Indians into the mainstream and modern times, even as it
steered the emerging shape of self-rule and spawned a new generation
of resistance. The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee is the essential,
intimate story of a resilient people in a transformative era.

**David Treuer** is Ojibwe from the Leech Lake Reservation in northern
Minnesota. The author of four previous novels, most recently Prudence,
and two books of nonfiction, he has also written for The New York
Times, Los Angeles Times, Esquire, Slate, and The Washington Post,
among others. He has a Ph.D. in anthropology and teaches literature
and creative writing at the University of Southern California.

There There is a wondrous and shattering portrait of an America few
of us have ever seen. It’s “masterful . . . white-hot
. . . devastating” (The Washington Post) at the same time as it is
fierce, funny, suspenseful, thoroughly modern, and impossible to put
down. Here is a voice we have never heard—a voice full of poetry and
rage, exploding onto the page with urgency and force. Tommy Orange
has written a stunning novel that grapples with a complex and
painful history, with an inheritance of beauty and profound
spirituality, and with a plague of addiction, abuse, and
suicide. This is the book that everyone is talking about right now,
and it’s destined to be a classic.

_The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide_

White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide is a 2016
nonfiction book by Emory University professor Carol Anderson. She had
been contracted to write the book following reaction to an op-ed she
wrote for The Washington Post in 2014.

Carefully linking historical flashpoints when social progress for
African Americans was countered by deliberate and cleverly crafted
opposition, Anderson pulls back the veil that has long covered actions
made in the name of protecting democracy, fiscal responsibility, or
protection against fraud, rendering visible the long lineage of white
rage. Compelling and dramatic in the unimpeachable history it relates,
White Rage will add an important new dimension to the national
conversation about race in America.

_The Genocidal Impact of American Indian Residential Schools_

For five consecutive generations, from roughly 1880 to 1980, Native
American children in the United States and Canada were forcibly taken
from their families and relocated to residential schools. The stated
goal of this government program was to "kill the Indian to save the
man." Half of the children did not survive the experience, and those
who did were left permanently scarred. The resulting alcoholism,
suicide, and the transmission of trauma to their own children has led
to a social disintegration with results that can only be described as
genocidal.

Struggle for the Land: Native North American Resistance to Genocide,
Ecocide and Colonization is a book by Ward Churchill. It is a
collection of essays on the efforts of Native Americans in the United
States and in Canada to maintain their land tenure claims against
government and corporate infringement. Equating colonization with
genocide and ecocide, the author provides examples of resistance.

Beginning with an overview of the impact of legal doctrines
established by the United States and Canada on Native people, and
moving on to explore a series of case studies indicative of the
effects of domination "by North America's settler-states," the book
concludes with a discussion paper offering a scenario for an alternate
future.

2002 by Gord Hill

An alternative and unorthodox view of the colonization of the Americas
by Europeans is offered in this concise history. Eurocentric studies
of the conquest of the Americas present colonization as a civilizing
force for good, and the native populations as primitive or
worse. Colonization is seen as a mutually beneficial process, in which
"civilization” was brought to the natives who in return shared their
land and cultures. The opposing historical camp views colonization as
a form of genocide in which the native populations were passive
victims overwhelmed by European military power. In this fresh
examination, an activist and historian of native descent argues that
the colonial powers met resistance from the indigenous inhabitants and
that these confrontations shaped the forms and extent of
colonialism. This account encompasses North and South America, the
development of nation-states, and the resurgence of indigenous
resistance in the post-World War II era.

Water for Life Poettree Publishings, Society of the People Struggling

edition, printed by Common Weath Printing. Near Fine in wrappers.

The first book by this Sioux poet/activist, who was a founder and
National Chairman of the radical American Indian Movement during the
1970s; a turbulent time of Native American political activism. Trudell
became the spokesman for the Indians of All Tribes who occupied
Alcatraz Island, which led to the founding of AIM. He was the Chair of
AIM during the Wounded Knee siege and the Pine Ridge battle that left
two FBI agents and one Indian youth dead and resulted in Leonard
Peltier's conviction and incarceration for murder. Trudell's own
family, his wife and three children, were killed in a fire set by an
arsonist, which Trudell has long considered to have been an attempt to
strike back at him for his radical activism and militancy, including
his advocacy of the use of violence in pursuing claims of Native
rights. He appeared in the documentary film about Peltier, Incident at
Oglala, and was later cast as a charismatic Indian leader in the
fictionalized film version of that story, Thunderheart. He is a
musician as well as a poet and is also known as an eloquent speaker,
both as a political leader and, more recently, as a guest lecturer.

_Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area_

Two hundred years ago, herds of elk and antelope dotted the hills of
the San Francisco-Monterey Bay area. Grizzly bears lumbered down to
the creeks to fish for silver salmon and steelhead trout. From vast
marshlands geese, ducks, and other birds rose in thick clouds "with
a sound like that of a hurricane." This land of "inexpressible
fertility," as one early explorer described it, supported one of the
densest Indian populations in all of North America.

Custer Died for Your Sins; an Indian Manifesto
----------------------------------------------

![Custer Died For Your Sins](images/1969-custer-deloria.jpg)

Vine Deloria Jr.
1969
Macmillan

Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto, is a 1969, non-fiction
book by the lawyer, professor and writer Vine Deloria, Jr. The book
was noteworthy for its relevance to the Alcatraz-Red Power Movement
and other activist organizations, such as the American Indian
Movement, which was beginning to expand.

Fifty-years years ago Vine Deloria, Jr., an enrolled citizen of the
Standing Rock Lakota Nation, published Custer Died for Your Sins: An
Indian Manifesto. For 1969 mainstream America the title was an
attention-grabbing, blasphemous play on the well-known and oft-used
Jesus-died-for-your-sins. Deloria took the phrase from a bumper
sticker of the same name that he had helped create and said it
referred to the bad faith the U.S. demonstrated in failing to fulfill
the provisions of the Sioux Treaty of 1868. He explained, “Under the
covenants of the Old Testament, breaking a covenant called for a blood
sacrifice for atonement. Custer was the blood sacrifice for the United
States breaking the Sioux treaty.”

The title was an apt label for a work that excoriated the actions,
white-washed history, and on-going racism of the times. Unfortunately,
fifty years on, while some of the references and observations are
clearly dated, the basic hard truths and embedded injustices continue
to underpin today’s Native reality.

Water for Life Poettree Publishings, Society of the People Struggling
to be Free, 1982. Jan Attridge, illustrator. Most likely a later
edition, printed by Common Weath Printing. Near Fine in wrappers.

The first book by this Sioux poet/activist, who was a founder and
National Chairman of the radical American Indian Movement during the
1970s; a turbulent time of Native American political activism. Trudell
became the spokesman for the Indians of All Tribes who occupied
Alcatraz Island, which led to the founding of AIM. He was the Chair of
AIM during the Wounded Knee siege and the Pine Ridge battle that left
two FBI agents and one Indian youth dead and resulted in Leonard
Peltier's conviction and incarceration for murder. Trudell's own
family, his wife and three children, were killed in a fire set by an
arsonist, which Trudell has long considered to have been an attempt to
strike back at him for his radical activism and militancy, including
his advocacy of the use of violence in pursuing claims of Native
rights. He appeared in the documentary film about Peltier, Incident at
Oglala, and was later cast as a charismatic Indian leader in the
fictionalized film version of that story, Thunderheart. He is a
musician as well as a poet and is also known as an eloquent speaker,
both as a political leader and, more recently, as a guest lecturer.

### _There, There_

![There, There by Tommy Orange](images/orange-2018-there.jpg)

There There is a wondrous and shattering portrait of an America few
of us have ever seen. It’s “masterful . . . white-hot
. . . devastating” (The Washington Post) at the same time as it is
fierce, funny, suspenseful, thoroughly modern, and impossible to put
down. Here is a voice we have never heard—a voice full of poetry and
rage, exploding onto the page with urgency and force. Tommy Orange
has written a stunning novel that grapples with a complex and
painful history, with an inheritance of beauty and profound
spirituality, and with a plague of addiction, abuse, and
suicide. This is the book that everyone is talking about right now,
and it’s destined to be a classic.

### White Rage

_The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide_

![White Rage](images/anderson-2017-rage.jpg)

White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide is a 2016
nonfiction book by Emory University professor Carol Anderson. She had
been contracted to write the book following reaction to an op-ed she
wrote for The Washington Post in 2014.

Carefully linking historical flashpoints when social progress for
African Americans was countered by deliberate and cleverly crafted
opposition, Anderson pulls back the veil that has long covered actions
made in the name of protecting democracy, fiscal responsibility, or
protection against fraud, rendering visible the long lineage of white
rage. Compelling and dramatic in the unimpeachable history it relates,
White Rage will add an important new dimension to the national
conversation about race in America.

### Kill the Indian, Save the Man

by Ward Churchill

2004 · City Lights Books · 128pp

_The Genocidal Impact of American Indian Residential Schools_

![Kill the Indian, Save the Man](images/churchill-2004-save.jpg)

For five consecutive generations, from roughly 1880 to 1980, Native
American children in the United States and Canada were forcibly taken
from their families and relocated to residential schools. The stated
goal of this government program was to "kill the Indian to save the
man." Half of the children did not survive the experience, and those
who did were left permanently scarred. The resulting alcoholism,
suicide, and the transmission of trauma to their own children has led
to a social disintegration with results that can only be described as
genocidal.

_Native North American Resistance to Genocide, Ecocide and Colonization_

![Struggle for the Land](images/churchill-2002-struggle.jpg)

Struggle for the Land: Native North American Resistance to Genocide,
Ecocide and Colonization is a book by Ward Churchill. It is a
collection of essays on the efforts of Native Americans in the United
States and in Canada to maintain their land tenure claims against
government and corporate infringement. Equating colonization with
genocide and ecocide, the author provides examples of resistance.

Beginning with an overview of the impact of legal doctrines
established by the United States and Canada on Native people, and
moving on to explore a series of case studies indicative of the
effects of domination "by North America's settler-states," the book
concludes with a discussion paper offering a scenario for an alternate
future.

### _The Ohlone Way_

_Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area_

![The Ohlone Way by Malcolm Margolin](margolin-1978-ohlone.jpg)

Two hundred years ago, herds of elk and antelope dotted the hills of
the San Francisco-Monterey Bay area. Grizzly bears lumbered down to
the creeks to fish for silver salmon and steelhead trout. From vast
marshlands geese, ducks, and other birds rose in thick clouds "with
a sound like that of a hurricane." This land of "inexpressible
fertility," as one early explorer described it, supported one of the
densest Indian populations in all of North America.

John Trudell's Writing career
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Trudell#Writing_career

> About six months after the deaths of his family, Trudell started
> writing poetry. He described his work, "They're called poems, but in
> reality they're lines given to me to hang on to."[22] He has written
> many poems, including "Baby Boom Che" and "Rant and Roll," and
> hundreds of others.
> 
> In the 2010s he often shared recent poetic musings and written
> works-in-progress via social media, such as his Facebook page.
> 
> Various impromptu videos of Trudell in live concert appearances or
> addressing political, social, indigenous rights and educational
> groups are posted on Google's Youtube.com, and although he was
> sought after by various print and broadcast media outlets for "sound
> byte commentary," Trudell preferred to speak in less frenetic style
> directly to gatherings assembled for specific causes that he
> supports (e.g., advocating on behalf of re-legalizing hemp
> cultivation for its many beneficial uses, including sustainable
> paper pulp).
> 
> Trudell often used his poetry as lyrics for recordings, and began in
> 1982 to set them to traditional American Indian music, which also in
> the 1980s eventually led to the recording of A.K.A Graffiti Man, as
> he struggled to make sense of bewildering situations that confronted
> him, including the loss of so many loved ones.
> 
> In late 1988, Australian rock band Midnight Oil invited Trudell (as
> Graffiti Man) to tour with them during their From Diesel and Dust to
> the Big Mountain world tour. They billed Trudell's part of the show
> as "Native American activist performance." Members of Midnight Oil
> played traditional instruments, sang in native American languages,
> and accompanied songs with heavy psychedelic Hendrix-style guitar,
> accompanying Trudell. This exposure brought Trudell new and larger
> audiences.[citation needed]
> 
> Trudell also toured in 1993 with Peter Gabriel's global WOMAD (World
> Music and Dance) production. He was billed as John Trudell,
> performing his traditional songs and reading his poetry.
> 
> In 2008, Trudell published a book, Lines From a Mined Mind: The
> Words of John Trudell, a collection of 25 years of poetry, lyrics
> and essays.

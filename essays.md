> I'd like to thank you all for coming to this place, and I'd like to
> give thanks for being welcomed here myself. And I would like to talk
> tonight in honor of all of us in the struggle who have lost our
> relations to the Spirit World. I would like to talk in honor of the
> wind, one of the natural elements. This is a survival gathering and
> one of the things I hope you all learn while you're here is ... to
> appreciate the energy and power that the elements are, tha t of the
> sun, the rain and the wind. I hope you go away from here
> understanding that this is power, the only real, true power. This is
> the only real, true connection we will ever have to power, our
> relationship to Mother Earth.

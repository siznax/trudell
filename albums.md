> John Trudell (February 15, 1946 – December 8, 2015) was an acclaimed
> poet, national recording artist, actor and activist whose
> international following reflects the universal language of his words,
> work and message. Trudell (Santee Sioux) was a spokesperson for the
> Indian of All Tribes occupation of Alcatraz Island from 1969 to
> 1971. He then worked with the American Indian Movement (AIM), serving
> as Chairman of AIM from 1973 to 1979. In February of 1979, a fire of
> unknown origin killed Trudell’s wife, three children and
> mother-in-law. It was through this horrific tragedy that Trudell began
> to find his voice as an artist and poet, writing, in his words, “to
> stay connected to this reality.”

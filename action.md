Abolish Columbus Day
--------------------

Zinned Project

It is time to stop celebrating the crimes of Columbus and stand in
solidarity with the Indigenous people who demand an end to Columbus
Day. Instead of glorifying a person who enslaved and murdered people,
destroyed cultures, and terrorized those who challenged his rule, we
seek to honor these communities demanding sovereignty, recognition,
and rights. We encourage schools to petition their administration and
for communities to introduce legislation to rename Columbus Day to
Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Below we provide information and resources to
join the campaign to Abolish Columbus Day.

Rematriate the Land: Give Shuumi
--------------------------------

_Sogorea Te Land Trust_

The Shuumi Land Tax directly supports Sogorea Te’s work of
rematriation, returning Indigenous land to Indigenous people,
establishing a cemetery to reinter stolen Ohlone ancestral remains and
building urban gardens, community centers, and ceremonial spaces so
current and future generations of Indigenous people can thrive in the
Bay Area. Shuumi means gift in the Ohlone language Chochenyo.

The Shuumi Land Tax is a voluntary annual contribution that
non-Indigenous people living on traditional Lisjan Ohlone territory
make to support the critical work of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust.

Save the West Berkeley Shellmound
---------------------------------

Indian People Organizing for Change (IPOC)

We [1] are currently working on trying to **protect the West Berkeley
Shellmound** in Berkeley, the oldest of the Shellmounds (~5700 years
old). Please help us in this effort by donating by clicking here [2]
Please visit our Facebook page called "West Berkeley Shellmound" [3].

http://www.crowdrise.com/save-the-west-berkeley-shellmound

A history of cultural desecration of Native American shellmounds, and
the plans for construction of a parking facility on land known to be
an ancestral site, led to the creation of an organization called the
Indian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) in 1999. The organization
seeks to defend and restore sacred sites for communal use through
community engagement. In 2011 IPOC occupied the sacred site Sogorea Te
on the Carquinez Strait for 109 days to prevent construction at the
site. [1]

Stop Junipero Serra Sainthood
-----------------------------

_Amah Mutsun Tribal Band_

California Indians Demand Cruelty to Ancestors be Disclosed as
California Mission Foundation tries to Declare El Camino Real a UNESCO
World Heritage Site. A proposal by the California Mission Foundation
to have the state’s famed El Camino Real route declared a UNESCO
Heritage Site is being bitterly opposed by state Indians who said it
would only "honor and glorify the brutal conquest" of Indian lands.

Support California MMIW, Media Protocol training, and Native Youth

Restoring Justice for Indigenous Peoples

**Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women**
California is one of the top 10 states that Indigenous women are
facing a crisis of survival. RJIP has been providing support to
impacted families through advocacy, healing circles, and helping to
create survivor centered spaces.

**Media Protocol**
Issues facing Indigenous peoples are severely underrepresented in
news/media platforms or have a very low degree of cultural
competency. RJIP holds trainings on how to accurately and impactfully
discuss these issues, as well as workshops on empowering our
communities to leverage new media to tell their own stories.

**Native Youth**
Our Indigenous youth in California face some of the most
disproportionate numbers of school suspensions and juvenile
detentions. RJIP is dedicated to Indigenous pathways to heal for
system impacted youth.

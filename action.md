Abolish Columbus Day
--------------------

_Zinned Project_

It is time to stop celebrating the crimes of Columbus and stand in
solidarity with the Indigenous people who demand an end to Columbus
Day. Instead of glorifying a person who enslaved and murdered people,
destroyed cultures, and terrorized those who challenged his rule, we
seek to honor these communities demanding sovereignty, recognition,
and rights. We encourage schools to petition their administration and
for communities to introduce legislation to rename Columbus Day to
Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Below we provide information and resources to
join the campaign to Abolish Columbus Day.

Clean Up Navajo Land and Water Contaminated by Uranium Mining
-------------------------------------------------------------

_Groundswell Educational Films_

Our new Navajo Boy webisode series introduces environmental
stories–like the contamination of Navajo water–from the point of view
of Navajos with flip video cameras. Each episode offers a witness and
a way to make a difference. You can help today by contributing to
Groundswell for shooting, editing, and a paid college internship that
will bring this program into Navajo communities.  Your support enables
Groundswell to keep Navajo environmental concerns in front of
policy-makers, responsible agencies, and mainstream media.

Make Billionaires Pay
---------------------

_Native Organizers Alliance_

Between mid-March and August 5, 2020 when the pandemic took hold in
the U.S., 467 of the nation’s nearly 650 billionaires have seen their
collective wealth ballooned by 30%―an increase of $732 billion, or
$5.2 billion a day, according to research from Americans for Tax
Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies.

At a time when millions of U.S. families are stretched to the breaking
point, our tax fairness champions U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and
U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, have introduced the **Make
Billionaire’s Pay Act** to place a one-time tax on the growth of
billionaire wealth between March 18, 2020 and the end of the year.

* Place a one-time 60% tax on the growth in billionaire wealth between
  March 18 - December 31, 2020.
* Use that revenue ($422 billion based on Aug. 5 wealth estimates from
  Forbes) to cover the out-of-pocket medical expenses of all those who
  are uninsured and those who are under-insured Medicare beneficiaries
  over the next 12 months during the COVID-19 crisis.
* Leave $310 billion (on Aug. 5) in wealth gains for these 467
  billionaires ― an extraordinary sum over 4 1/2 months.

Rematriate the Land: Give Shuumi
--------------------------------

_Sogorea Te Land Trust_

The Shuumi Land Tax directly supports Sogorea Te’s work of
rematriation, returning Indigenous land to Indigenous people,
establishing a cemetery to reinter stolen Ohlone ancestral remains and
building urban gardens, community centers, and ceremonial spaces so
current and future generations of Indigenous people can thrive in the
Bay Area. Shuumi means gift in the Ohlone language Chochenyo.

The Shuumi Land Tax is a voluntary annual contribution that
non-Indigenous people living on traditional Lisjan Ohlone territory
make to support the critical work of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust.

Restore Buffalo to Indian Country
---------------------------------

To reestablish healthy buffalo populations on Tribal lands is to
reestablish hope for Indian people. By returning the buffalo to Tribal
lands will help heal the land, the animal, and the spirit of the
Indian people.

ITBC has a membership of 69 tribes in 19 states and has restored more
than 20,000 buffalo to Tribal lands. ITBC is committed to
reestablishing buffalo herds on Indian lands in a manner that promotes
cultural enhancement, spiritual revitalization, ecological
restoration, and economic development.

Donations of any amount are greatly appreciated and will be used to
assist in the restoration of the Buffalo to American Indian Lands.

Restore Justice for California MMIW and Native Youth
----------------------------------------------------

_Restoring Justice for Indigenous Peoples_

**Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women**
California is one of the top 10 states that Indigenous women are
facing a crisis of survival. RJIP has been providing support to
impacted families through advocacy, healing circles, and helping to
create survivor centered spaces.

**Media Protocol**
Issues facing Indigenous peoples are severely underrepresented in
news/media platforms or have a very low degree of cultural
competency. RJIP holds trainings on how to accurately and impactfully
discuss these issues, as well as workshops on empowering our
communities to leverage new media to tell their own stories.

**Native Youth**
Our Indigenous youth in California face some of the most
disproportionate numbers of school suspensions and juvenile
detentions. RJIP is dedicated to Indigenous pathways to heal for
system impacted youth.

Save the West Berkeley Shellmound
---------------------------------

_Indian People Organizing for Change (IPOC)_

Save West Berkeley Shellmound and Village Site is a coalition of
Ohlone tribes, indigenous organizations, and individuals who advocate
for historic preservation, indigenous sovereignty and environmental
justice.

https://shellmound.org/

We [1] are currently working on trying to **protect the West Berkeley
Shellmound** in Berkeley, the oldest of the Shellmounds (~5700 years
old). Please help us in this effort by donating by clicking here [2]
Please visit our Facebook page called "West Berkeley Shellmound" [3].

http://www.crowdrise.com/save-the-west-berkeley-shellmound

A history of cultural desecration of Native American shellmounds, and
the plans for construction of a parking facility on land known to be
an ancestral site, led to the creation of an organization called the
Indian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) in 1999. The organization
seeks to defend and restore sacred sites for communal use through
community engagement. In 2011 IPOC occupied the sacred site Sogorea Te
on the Carquinez Strait for 109 days to prevent construction at the
site. [1]

Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline
-------------------------------

_Stand with Standing Rock_

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe this week
landed what supporters are calling an unprecedented win in their fight
against the Dakota Access Pipeline, with a judge ordering the pipeline
shut down for additional environmental review. (August 2020)

Over the years, the #NoDAPL movement has captivated all of Indian
Country, with Indigenous people and allies the world over joining
together to support the “Oceti Sakowin” camp on the Standing Rock
Reservation in North Dakota.

Stop LINE 3
-----------

Since 2014, thousands of Minnesotans have shown up at hearings, talked
to neighbors, written letters, and organized in their communities to
oppose Enbridge’s Line 3 tar sands oil pipeline. Line 3 is a clear
danger to our climate, water, and land in Minnesota, and would
undermine the Indigenous treaty rights of the Anishinaabe people.

### Water Protector Welcome Center

We welcome all water protectors and supporters to come to the
Mississippi River to pray, to witness, and to resist the destruction
of these public lands and waterways in Anishinaabe territory.

Stop Further Construction on Mauna Kea

Mauna Kea is ancestrally, culturally and spiritually sacred to Kanaka
Maoli, and the spiritual and physical health of the mountain, is
reflective of the spiritual and physical health of her people.

**Mauna Kea is significant to the entire world, connected to all
mountains and waters, all places and all people. This is not just
about one mountain in Hawai’i. This is a global movement and the world
is watching.**

to have the state’s famed El Camino Real route declared a UNESCO

Take the Indigenous Futures Survey
----------------------------------

Indigenous Futures Survey
Until now, Native people have never been asked about what issues
matter to us. The Indigenous Futures Survey centers Native voices and
provides an opportunity for all Native peoples to be a part of shaping
the future. Native Organizers Alliance has partnered with IllumiNative
and Aspen Institute’s Center for Native American Youth to conduct the
largest survey of Native people ever conducted.

The survey will explore the impact of Covid-19 on Native peoples,
their families and community, issue priorities for the upcoming
election, how racism and discrimination impact Native peoples’ lives
and visions for the future of Indian Country. Take the 10-minute
survey now and become eligible to win raffle prizes like Nike N7
shoes, beaded jewelry, original artwork, and gift cards to your
favorite Native brands. Your voice matters.

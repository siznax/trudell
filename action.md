Abolish Columbus Day
--------------------

Zinned Project

It is time to stop celebrating the crimes of Columbus and stand in
solidarity with the Indigenous people who demand an end to Columbus
Day. Instead of glorifying a person who enslaved and murdered people,
destroyed cultures, and terrorized those who challenged his rule, we
seek to honor these communities demanding sovereignty, recognition,
and rights. We encourage schools to petition their administration and
for communities to introduce legislation to rename Columbus Day to
Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Below we provide information and resources to
join the campaign to Abolish Columbus Day.

Save the West Berkeley Shellmound
---------------------------------

Indian People Organizing for Change (IPOC)

We [1] are currently working on trying to **protect the West Berkeley
Shellmound** in Berkeley, the oldest of the Shellmounds (~5700 years
old). Please help us in this effort by donating by clicking here [2]
Please visit our Facebook page called "West Berkeley Shellmound" [3].

A history of cultural desecration of Native American shellmounds, and
the plans for construction of a parking facility on land known to be
an ancestral site, led to the creation of an organization called the
Indian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) in 1999. The organization
seeks to defend and restore sacred sites for communal use through
community engagement. In 2011 IPOC occupied the sacred site Sogorea Te
on the Carquinez Strait for 109 days to prevent construction at the
site. [1]

Support California MMIW, Media Protocol training, and Native Youth
------------------------------------------------------------------

Restoring Justice for Indigenous Peoples

**Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women**
California is one of the top 10 states that Indigenous women are
facing a crisis of survival. RJIP has been providing support to
impacted families through advocacy, healing circles, and helping to
create survivor centered spaces.

**Media Protocol**
Issues facing Indigenous peoples are severely underrepresented in
news/media platforms or have a very low degree of cultural
competency. RJIP holds trainings on how to accurately and impactfully
discuss these issues, as well as workshops on empowering our
communities to leverage new media to tell their own stories.

**Native Youth**
Our Indigenous youth in California face some of the most
disproportionate numbers of school suspensions and juvenile
detentions. RJIP is dedicated to Indigenous pathways to heal for
system impacted youth.

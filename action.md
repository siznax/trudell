### Restoring Justice for Indigenous Peoples

_Support for California MMIW, Media Protocol training, and Native Youth_

**Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women**
California is one of the top 10 states that Indigenous women are
facing a crisis of survival. RJIP has been providing support to
impacted families through advocacy, healing circles, and helping to
create survivor centered spaces.

**Media Protocol**
Issues facing Indigenous peoples are severely underrepresented in
news/media platforms or have a very low degree of cultural
competency. RJIP holds trainings on how to accurately and impactfully
discuss these issues, as well as workshops on empowering our
communities to leverage new media to tell their own stories.

**Native Youth**
Our Indigenous youth in California face some of the most
disproportionate numbers of school suspensions and juvenile
detentions. RJIP is dedicated to Indigenous pathways to heal for
system impacted youth.

Zinned Project: Abolish Columbus Day
------------------------------------

It is time to stop celebrating the crimes of Columbus and stand in
solidarity with the Indigenous people who demand an end to Columbus
Day. Instead of glorifying a person who enslaved and murdered people,
destroyed cultures, and terrorized those who challenged his rule, we
seek to honor these communities demanding sovereignty, recognition,
and rights. We encourage schools to petition their administration and
for communities to introduce legislation to rename Columbus Day to
Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Below we provide information and resources to
join the campaign to Abolish Columbus Day.

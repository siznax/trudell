Abolish Columbus Day
--------------------

_Zinned Project_

It is time to stop celebrating the crimes of Columbus and stand in
solidarity with the Indigenous people who demand an end to Columbus
Day. Instead of glorifying a person who enslaved and murdered people,
destroyed cultures, and terrorized those who challenged his rule, we
seek to honor these communities demanding sovereignty, recognition,
and rights. We encourage schools to petition their administration and
for communities to introduce legislation to rename Columbus Day to
Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Below we provide information and resources to
join the campaign to Abolish Columbus Day.

Clean Up Navajo Land and Water Contaminated by Uranium Mining
-------------------------------------------------------------

_Groundswell Educational Films_

Our new Navajo Boy webisode series introduces environmental
stories–like the contamination of Navajo water–from the point of view
of Navajos with flip video cameras. Each episode offers a witness and
a way to make a difference. You can help today by contributing to
Groundswell for shooting, editing, and a paid college internship that
will bring this program into Navajo communities.  Your support enables
Groundswell to keep Navajo environmental concerns in front of
policy-makers, responsible agencies, and mainstream media.

Protect Juristac
----------------

_Amah Mutsun Tribal Band_

Petition to Santa Clara County: Protect Amah Mutsun Sacred Grounds
from Proposed Quarry. We invite you to stand with the **Amah Mutsun
Tribal Band** in saying NO to sand and gravel mining at
Juristac. Please sign our petition here.

Rematriate the Land: Give Shuumi
--------------------------------

_Sogorea Te Land Trust_

The Shuumi Land Tax directly supports Sogorea Te’s work of
rematriation, returning Indigenous land to Indigenous people,
establishing a cemetery to reinter stolen Ohlone ancestral remains and
building urban gardens, community centers, and ceremonial spaces so
current and future generations of Indigenous people can thrive in the
Bay Area. Shuumi means gift in the Ohlone language Chochenyo.

The Shuumi Land Tax is a voluntary annual contribution that
non-Indigenous people living on traditional Lisjan Ohlone territory
make to support the critical work of the Sogorea Te’ Land Trust.

Restore Justice for California MMIW and Native Youth
----------------------------------------------------

_Restoring Justice for Indigenous Peoples_

**Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women**
California is one of the top 10 states that Indigenous women are
facing a crisis of survival. RJIP has been providing support to
impacted families through advocacy, healing circles, and helping to
create survivor centered spaces.

**Media Protocol**
Issues facing Indigenous peoples are severely underrepresented in
news/media platforms or have a very low degree of cultural
competency. RJIP holds trainings on how to accurately and impactfully
discuss these issues, as well as workshops on empowering our
communities to leverage new media to tell their own stories.

**Native Youth**
Our Indigenous youth in California face some of the most
disproportionate numbers of school suspensions and juvenile
detentions. RJIP is dedicated to Indigenous pathways to heal for
system impacted youth.

Save the West Berkeley Shellmound
---------------------------------

_Indian People Organizing for Change (IPOC)_

Save West Berkeley Shellmound and Village Site is a coalition of
Ohlone tribes, indigenous organizations, and individuals who advocate
for historic preservation, indigenous sovereignty and environmental
justice.

https://shellmound.org/

We [1] are currently working on trying to **protect the West Berkeley
Shellmound** in Berkeley, the oldest of the Shellmounds (~5700 years
old). Please help us in this effort by donating by clicking here [2]
Please visit our Facebook page called "West Berkeley Shellmound" [3].

http://www.crowdrise.com/save-the-west-berkeley-shellmound

A history of cultural desecration of Native American shellmounds, and
the plans for construction of a parking facility on land known to be
an ancestral site, led to the creation of an organization called the
Indian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) in 1999. The organization
seeks to defend and restore sacred sites for communal use through
community engagement. In 2011 IPOC occupied the sacred site Sogorea Te
on the Carquinez Strait for 109 days to prevent construction at the
site. [1]

Stop the Dakota Access Pipeline
-------------------------------

_Stand with Standing Rock_

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe this week
landed what supporters are calling an unprecedented win in their fight
against the Dakota Access Pipeline, with a judge ordering the pipeline
shut down for additional environmental review. (August 2020)

Over the years, the #NoDAPL movement has captivated all of Indian
Country, with Indigenous people and allies the world over joining
together to support the “Oceti Sakowin” camp on the Standing Rock
Reservation in North Dakota.

NoDAPL direct action in North Dakota, and in other actions and
trainings throughout Turtle Island.

Red Warrior Society’s mantra is “Everything for Everyone, Nothing for
Ourselves.” We acknowledge the long legacy of warrior societies’
continued struggle for indigenous liberation and environmental
justice.

Stop Junípero Serra Sainthood
-----------------------------

_Amah Mutsun Tribal Band_

California Indians Demand Cruelty to Ancestors be Disclosed as
California Mission Foundation tries to Declare El Camino Real a UNESCO
World Heritage Site. A proposal by the California Mission Foundation
to have the state’s famed El Camino Real route declared a UNESCO
Heritage Site is being bitterly opposed by state Indians who said it
would only "honor and glorify the brutal conquest" of Indian lands.

Take the Indigenous Futures Survey

Indigenous Futures Survey
Until now, Native people have never been asked about what issues
matter to us. The Indigenous Futures Survey centers Native voices and
provides an opportunity for all Native peoples to be a part of shaping
the future. Native Organizers Alliance has partnered with IllumiNative
and Aspen Institute’s Center for Native American Youth to conduct the
largest survey of Native people ever conducted.

The survey will explore the impact of Covid-19 on Native peoples,
their families and community, issue priorities for the upcoming
election, how racism and discrimination impact Native peoples’ lives
and visions for the future of Indian Country. Take the 10-minute
survey now and become eligible to win raffle prizes like Nike N7
shoes, beaded jewelry, original artwork, and gift cards to your
favorite Native brands. Your voice matters.

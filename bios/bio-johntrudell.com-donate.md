John Trudell (1946-2015) was a leader for the Indian of All Tribes
Occupation of Alcatraz in 1969, and went on to serve as Chairman of
the American Indian Movement (AIM) from 1973-1979. On February 11,
1979, he burned an American flag on the steps of the F.B.I J. Edgar
Hoover building in Washington D.C., as he’d been taught in the
military to burn the flag once it had been desecrated; and the US
government’s treatment of Native Americans and its classism and racism
had desecrated the flag. Some 12 hours after the flag incident, a fire
“of suspicious origin” burned down Trudell’s home on the
Shoshone-Paiute reservation in Nevada, killing Trudell’s pregnant
wife, Tina, their three children and Tina’s mother.

The F.B.I. declined to investigate, and the blaze was officially ruled
an “accident.” After the fire, Trudell turned his tears into writing
poetry and later, spoken word music and acting. A lifelong activist
and human rights advocate, he was quoted as saying “I’m just a human
being trying to make it in a world that is rapidly losing its
understanding of being human.”

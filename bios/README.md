### The Pines

John Trudell was one of the leaders for the Indian of All Tribes
Occupation of Alcatraz in 1969, ran Radio Free Alcatraz, and went on
to serve as Chairman of the American Indian Movement (AIM) from
1973-1979. On February 11, 1979, he burned an American flag on the
steps of the F.B.I J. Edgar Hoover building in Washington D.C.,
explaining that he had been taught in the military to burn the flag
once it had been desecrated; and that the US government’s treatment of
Native Americans, and the country’s classism and racism had desecrated
the flag. About 12 hours after the flag incident, in the early morning
of Abraham Lincoln’s birthday, a fire “of suspicious origin” burned
down Trudell’s home on the Shoshone Palute reservation in Nevada,
killing Trudell’s pregnant wife, Tina, their three children and Tina’s
mother. The F.B.I. declined to investigate, and the blaze was
officially ruled an “accident.” 

He turned his tears into writing poetry and later, music and
acting. He released several volumes of poetry and appearing in such
films as Thunderheart and Smoke Signals. He also recorded several
highly regarded albums combining spoken word and music. A lifelong
activist and human rights advocate, he was quoted as saying “I’m just
a human being trying to make it in a world that is rapidly losing its
understanding of being human.”

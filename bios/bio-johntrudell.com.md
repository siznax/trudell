## John Trudell has been identified as a poet, a fighter for Native American rights, an agitator, and lots of other things.

But if you were to have asked him which of these descriptions best
suits him he would have refused to be pinned down. “Actually I don’t
consider myself to be any of those things. They’re things that I
do…but they’re parts of me. They’re not the total.” Indeed, Trudell
was the complex sum of all that he saw, endured and accomplished in
his 69 years, a time in which he experienced more than most people
might in several lifetimes.

John Trudell did not set out to be a poet. He never studied poetry in
school. He took that road primarily through a series of detours, and
his poetic and political sensibilities were forged by the remarkable,
sometimes horrifying circumstances of his life.

John Trudell was born on February 15, 1946 in Omaha, Nebraska, and
grew up on and around the nearby Santee Sioux reservation. (His father
was a Santee, his mother’s tribal roots were in Mexico.) Trudell
became acquainted with hardship at an early age. His mother died when
he was 6, and he watched his father struggle to feed and clothe his
large family. This experience left Trudell with a deep contempt for
the American “work ethic,” compounded by the endemic racial and
economic injustice which surrounded him.John Trudell Biography

In 1963, like so many young people with limited economic
opportunities, Trudell found himself in the military. Trudell saw
active Navy duty in the coastal waters off Vietnam, on a ship doing
search-and-rescue missions for downed pilots. What combat he saw was
from a distance. But Trudell’s heritage sensitized him to the racism
he saw during the war, whether by Americans toward Asians, or the
U.S. military toward its own minority troops.

## Trudell left the Navy after four years.

A résumé he put together for a press kit a few years ago contains the
following listing:

### 1967 – 1969: Jobs, School, Disillusionment

Among the illusions Trudell quickly abandoned was that military
service was a way of buying into the American dream. He then had a
series of unsatisfying educational experiences. “I was in a holding
pattern,” he said, until 1969, when his sense of indigenous roots and
connections was galvanized by the Indians of All Tribes Occupation of
Alcatraz Island.John Trudell Alcatraz Reunion That event, for which
Trudell acted as national spokesman, was the first time that the
plight of Native Americans was brought into mainstream American
consciousness. And along with the recognition of the media came the
attention of the U.S. government, particularly that of the F.B.I.

The occupation of Alcatraz Island eventually wound down, ending
in 1971. But something more lasting was poised to replace it: the
American Indian Movement, of which Trudell served as National Chairman
from 1973 to 1979. The government response to A.I.M. was swift:
Trudell bluntly states, “They waged war against us. They hunted us
down. They killed, jailed, destroyed, by any means necessary. They saw
that magical thing that happened with Alcatraz…all of a sudden all
this pirit is popping up and gaining momentum through A.I.M., and this
is why the spirit-hunters, those who hunt free thought, came after
us.” A 17,000 page F.B.I. file bearing Trudell’s name remains a
testament to his years under government scrutiny.

**In 1979 that war took a terrible personal toll on John Trudell, in
the form of an unspeable tragedy that changed his life forever.**

On February 11, 1979 Trudell had burned an American flag during a
demonstration in front of the J.Edgar Hoover building, the
headquarters of the F.B.I. In Washington, DC, Trudell explained his
motives for the flag-burning. “In the military, they said if the flag
has been desecrated, the only way to properly dispose of it is to burn
it. But they defined desecration of the flag as if it drops on the
earth. I say injustice and racism and classism and your whole way of
life desecrates whatever you say this thing’s supposed to mean.” About
12 hours after the flag incident, in the early morning of Abraham
Lincoln’s birthday, a fire “of suspicious origin” burned down
Trudell’s home on the Shoshone Palute reservation in Nevada, killing
Trudell’s wife, Tina, their three children and Tina’s mother. Not
surprisingly, the F.B.I. declined to investigate, and the blaze was
officially ruled an “accident.” But Trudell flatly stated “It was
murder; they were murdered as an act of war.”

Devastated by the tragedy, Trudell withdrew from the world for a time,
and it was during this period of grief and exile that Trudell
discovered his poetic gift. “It was when I was looking for something
to hang on to, to keep me connected to this reality, that I started
writing. I did not write poetry prior to that…Tina was the writer. She
wrote poetry. And almost six months after the fire, when I was looking
for help — I was looking to cut any spiritual deal. I was pissed off
at God, at the Great Spirit, at all of ’em because this was a betrayal
to me… And then the lines came. The lines were my bombs, my
explosions, my tears, they were my everything.”

**What began as a form of therapy soon turned into much more: the
words poured out of Trudell, and he began to incorporate poetry into
his speaking engagements.**

In 1982 he published a book of poems, Living in Reality. But he was
searching for a new mode of presentation and soon he became inspired,
in part, by someone who was to become his close friend, Jackson
Browne. “In 1979 I met Jackson. He allowed me to roam around in his
world, so I was around recording studios, and musicians. And I’ve
always like rock ‘n’ roll anyway. I just considered it to be a period
of osmosis. By ’82 I had decided that I wanted to try to record the
poetry with music, but I didn’t know how I was going to work with
contemporary musicians. So I began by putting the poetry with the
oldest musical form. For us, that meant the drum and the chants. We
ended up recording a tape called TRIBAL VOICE at Jackson’s studio. And
when that was recorded, I wanted to then mix the spoken word with the
latest musical forms…synthesizers, electric guitars, drum machines. I
stayed on hold with that one for two years because it was very hard
for me to find someone who would work with me on the music. To me it
was important that it remain spoken word. I wanted to mix those two
identities, music and poetry. I wanted those two identities to be
distinct, yet together.

## “Then I met Jesse Ed Davis on May Day, 1985,”

Jesse Ed Davis, himself a Kiowa from Oklahoma, was something of a
musical legend, having recorded and toured with the likes of Jackson
Browne, Bob Dylan, all of the former Beatles and countless others. His
innate understanding of blues and rock ‘n’ roll turned out to be just
what Trudell had been looking for. He remembers that first meeting
fondly: “He told me his name. And the very next thing he said to me
was, ‘I can make music for your words.'”

Together, Trudell and Davis started gigging and recording as The
Graffiti Band, and this partnership produced its first album titled
AKA GRAFITTI MAN, in 1986. It was released on Trudell’s own Peach
Company label in a cassette-only format, and sold through mail-order
and at the band’s shows. Even with this limited distraction, the album
attracted considerable attention and critical praise, including
supporters like Bob Dylan. In an interview in Rolling Stone, Dylan
called AKA GRAFITTI MAN “the best album of 1986,” and had the album
played over the P.A. system during intermissions in his 1987
tour. Among Trudell’s other fans is Kris Kristofferson, who wrote the
song “Johnny Lobo” as a tribute to his remarkable life.

Trudell and Jesse Ed Davis recorded a second album together, HEART
JUMP BOUQUET. Following Davis’ untimely death in 1988, Trudell began
to collaborate with Mark Shark, who had been the rhythm guitarist in
the Graffiti Band. With Shark as co-writer, Trudell and the Graffiti
Band recorded a third album, FABLES AND OTHER REALITIES (a second in
the “Tribal Voice” series, titled …BUT THIS ISN’T EL SALVADOR, had
been released in 1987). The band toured in 1988 as an opening act for
the Australian rock band Midnight Oil.

**In 1992, Rykodisc released AKA GRAFITTI MAN to an international
audience for the first time.**

The release gathered work from all of Trudell’s albums (except the
first TRIBAL VOICE recording), covering a period from 1985
to 1991. The original recordings were remixed and overdubs added
(including guest vocals by Browne and Kristofferson), but the essence
of the work remained intact, particularly in the searing guitar work
of Jesse Ed Davis.

This work represents a broader spectrum of Trudell’s concern from the
most global to the most personal. His keen poetic eye and ear touch on
the Persian Gulf war in “Bombs Over Bagdad,” in which he refers to
George Bush as “Queen George.” “The line was originally “King George’s
war,” he explained, “but that’s not what’s going on…he’s trying to
prove his machismo.” Another famous American is the subject of much
more sympathetic treatment in “Baby Boom Che.” Elvis Presley, who, as
the song title suggests, Trudell considered a cultural
revolutionary. “Yeah,” he laughs, “Elvis liberated a lot of white
people from Lawrence Welk!” The album’s other tracks cover the vast
range of the poet’s social and personal concerns — incisive song-poems
contain images of the decaying American dream (as on “Graffiti Man”),
but also loving remembrances of Trudell’s wife (“Tina Smiled”). The
album is infused throughout with Trudell’s deep belief in the human
spirit, and the spirit of the Earth itself.

At the time of AKA GRAFITTI MAN’s release, Trudell’s visibility was
increasing in other media as well. He was interviewed at length in the
Michael Apted film “Incident at Oglala,” a documentary about Native
American prisoner of conscience Leonard Peltier and the American
Indian Movement. He also had a featured role in the Tribeca Films
release “Thunderheart,” starring Val Kilmer and Sam Shephard, also
directed by Apted, released in April 1992.

Once John Trudell was asked about events surrounding the 500th
anniversary of Christopher Columbus’ “discovery” of America. He
replied, “Columbus was lost. He didn’t have an idea what planet he was
on, he didn’t have a clue where he was at. And then I think of the
descendants of Columbus..they’re lost too. They don’t know where their
lives are going. There’s a way to live and a way to exist. We’re here
so we should be living, rather than just existing. That’s what
Alcatraz and the A.I.M. were all about. We call it sovereignty,
honoring treaties, but it really has to do with life.”

**As an artist, as an activist, as a human being, John Trudell demands
to live.**
 

## WHAT OTHERS SAY ABOUT JOHN TRUDELL
 
“The triumph of John Trudell is that he has been able to bring the
strength of a brilliant activist into the arena of the arts — tender,
intact, but still on fire.”
— Buffy Sainte-Marie, Interview

“More than any man I know, John Trudell’s life is the expression of
his beliefs. Most of us muddle through the day with our ideals in
tow, but John’s politics, art and way of life perfectly reflect his
passion and energy for the Native American cause. He was an
inspiration to me in making the documentary film “Incident at
Oglala,” about Leonard Peltier’s fight for justice, so much so that I
cast him as the charismatic Indian leader in “Thunderheart,” a movie
that deals with the government oppression of the contemporary Native
American. There wasn’t an untruthful moment in his
performance. ‘Sometimes they have to kill us,” he sold me, ‘because
they cannot break our spirit.’ John is one of those rare unbreakable
spirits.”
— Michael Apted, Director

“A former AIM leader who suffered tragically for his commitment to
justice for his people, Trudell, in just a few appearances, charges
the film [THUNDERHEART] with authenticity and passion.”
— Peter Keough, Boston Phoenix

“Probably the most charismatic speaker I’ve ever heard.”
— Bonnie Raitt

“AKA GRAFITTI MAN is the best album of 1986. Only people like Lou
Reed and John Doe can dream about doing work like this.”
— Bob Dylan

“John Trudell is a crazy long wolf, poet, prophet, preacher, warrior
full of pain and fun and laughter and love, spilling out a vision of
fable and truth, love and war, from the unique and somewhat desperate
point of view of the Wild American. He’s a reality check. No
paranoid; he’s aware of the Enemy (a formidable Predator with no
respect for any form of life). Justice is a fire that burns inside
him. His spirit cries out for it. It makes him dangerous.”
— Kris Kristofferson

“The passing of John Trudell comes as such sad news. I’d known of
John ever since his work with my guitar player friend Jesse Ed Davis
and their group AKA Grafitti Man. His poetry, the sound of his voice,
was so powerful. I knew of his activism as the spokesperson for the
United Indians Of All Tribes takeover of Alcatraz and his leadership
in the American Indian Movement. John and I worked together several
times over the years, and each time I grew to admire him more. His
acting in film was terrific. His music was outstanding. His prose and
poetry were beautiful. And more than anything he was a solid stand-up
guy. I cherished his friendship and will miss him deeply.”
— Robbie Robertson

“I’m so sorry to mark the passing of my friend, John Trudell, who was
one of the most committed Native American activists and
environmentalists, as well as a brilliant spoken word poet. My
thoughts are with his family tonight. Rest in peace, dear friend.”
— Bonnie Raitt

“On Jim’s birthday, another great artist passed. John Trudell was
(is) a major, shamanic Native American singer/songwriter whom I had
the honor to give a Native American Music Award to… he is in the
happy hunting ground… blessings…”
— John Densmore

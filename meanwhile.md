Bolsonaro’s campaign to expand large-scale mining and ranching in
the Amazon has caused an increase of deforestation on indigenous
land by 74% from 2018 to 2019. Of the 24 murders of land defenders
in Brazil, 90% occurred in the Amazon.

2018-2019: 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE THIRD WORLD LIBERATION FRONT

The pivotal 1969 UC Berkeley student movement, the Third World
Liberation Front (twLF), helped established Ethnic Studies as an
interdisciplinary field in the U.S.  Marking the upcoming 50th
anniversary of the twLF, this research initiative will produce a
year-long series of events, discussions, exhibits, and an online
digital portal that archives and documents twLF’s critical role in
shaping UC Berkeley’s identity, its relationship with Bay Area-based
1960s social movements, and its impact on the inception and
development of Ethnic Studies. Initiative members include students,
staff, and faculty from the Center for Race & Gender, the Ethnic
Studies Library, the Multicultural Community Center, the Ethnic
Studies and African American Studies Departments, and American
Cultures.

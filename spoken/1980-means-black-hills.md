### Black Hills Speech (1980) Russell Means

> The only possible opening for a statement of this kind is that I
> detest writing. The process itself epitomizes the European concept
> of “legitimate” thinking; what is written has an importance that is
> denied the spoken. My culture, the Lakota culture, has an oral
> tradition, so I ordinarily reject writing. It is one of the white
> world’s ways of destroying the cultures of non-European peoples, the
> imposing of an abstraction over the spoken relationship of a people.

Various impromptu videos of Trudell in live concert appearances or
addressing political, social, indigenous rights and educational groups
are posted on Google's Youtube.com, and although he was sought after
by various print and broadcast media outlets for "sound byte
commentary," Trudell preferred to speak in less frenetic style
directly to gatherings assembled for specific causes that he supports
(e.g., advocating on behalf of re-legalizing hemp cultivation for its
many beneficial uses, including sustainable paper pulp).

Trudell also toured in 1993 with Peter Gabriel's global WOMAD (World
Music and Dance) production. He was billed as John Trudell,
performing his traditional songs and reading his poetry.

> I'd like to thank you all for coming to this place, and I'd like to
> give thanks for being welcomed here myself. And I would like to talk
> tonight in honor of all of us in the struggle who have lost our
> relations to the Spirit World. I would like to talk in honor of the
> wind, one of the natural elements. This is a survival gathering and
> one of the things I hope you all learn while you're here is ... to
> appreciate the energy and power that the elements are, tha t of the
> sun, the rain and the wind. I hope you go away from here
> understanding that this is power, the only real, true power. This is
> the only real, true connection we will ever have to power, our
> relationship to Mother Earth.

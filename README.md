### A [Lakota timeline](timeline.md)

* 1824: Bureau of Indian Affairs created within the War Department
* 1851: First Treaty of Fort Laramie marks boundaries of Lakota Nation
* 1861: The Homestead Act signed by Lincoln unleashed a flood of white
  settlers into native lands
* 1863: Sioux uprising ends with hanging of 38 Sioux men (the largest
  mass execution in U.S. history), order signed by Lincoln two days
  after the Emancipation Proclamation
* 1866: **Transcontinental railroad** construction begins. Lakota
  lands appropriated to shortcut trails and trains through the heart
  of the Lakota nation. Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated
  the U.S. Army many times over.
* 1868: Second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly gaurantees the sovereignty
  of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakota's ownership of the Sacred
  Black Hills and promises to close Powder River Country to all
  whites. This is the only war in American history in which the
  government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by
  the enemy.
* 1869: **Transcontinental Railroad** finished, carries large numbers
  of hunters for the wholesale killing of buffalo eliminating a source
  of food, clothing, and shelter for the Sioux.
* 1871: Indian Appropriation Act makes all Indians wards of the
  federal government and forbids them to leave reservations, making
  all western indians prisoners of war.
* 1871: End of treaty-making; "the problem with treaties is that they
  allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations and we can't have
  that. We have plans."
* 1874: General George Custer announces the discovery of gold in the
  Black Hills. An influx of white gold miners enters Lakota
  territory.
* 1875: Lakota War begins
* 1876: Custer's 7th Cavalry crushed at the Battle of the Little Big
  Horn 
* 1877: Great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse surrendered
  and was later killed in custody
* 1877: Surrender requires 75% of Lakota men to "sell or starve", only
  10% sign
* 1887: Dawes Act ends communal land ownership, distributes tracts of
  land to tribes and "dispose of" of remainder. The tribes lose
  millions of acres. Individuals become land owners and reservations
  were divided until nothing was left, making it easier to sub-divide
  and sell with each generation. Most of the surplus land and plots
  within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white
  ranchers.
* 1890: Wounded-Knee massacre, U.S. troops massacre Chief Bigfoot and
  300 prisoners of war using a new weapon: The Hodgekiss Gun, 20
  congressional medals of honor awarded, the most ever awarded for a
  single battle. Considered the end of the Indian Wars.
  
"More medals were given for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and
children than for any battle in World War I, World War II, Korean,
Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan"

* 1900: U.S. Indian population less than 250,000 compared to 8 million
  in 1492.
* 1980: longest running court case in U.S. history, _The Sioux Nation
  v. the United States_ U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Black Hills
  were illegally taken and that the Sioux Nation should be awarded
  $106 million dollars. The Sioux refuse saying, "The Black Hills Are
  Not For Sale"
* 2010: statistics reveal the legacy of colonization, forced
  migration, and treaty violations...

  awarded, the most ever awarded for a single battle. Considered the
  end of the Indian Wars.
* 1887: Dawes Act ends communal land ownership, distributes tracts of
  land to tribes and "dispose of" of remainder. The tribes lose
  millions of acres. Individuals become land owners and reservations
  were divided until nothing was left, making it easier to sub-divide
  and sell with each generation. Most of the surplus land and plots
  within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white
  ranchers.

  of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakota's ownership of the Sacred

  government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by
  the enemy.

  lands appropriated to shortcut trails and trains through the heart
  of the Lakota nation. Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated

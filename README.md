# "We must go beyond the arrogance of human rights. We must go beyond the ignorance of civil rights. We must step into the reality of natural rights because all of the natural world has a right to existence and we are only a small part of it." â€”John Trudell (1946-2015)

  land to tribes and "dispose of" of remainder. The tribes lose
  millions of acres. Individuals become land owners and reservations

  of the Great Sioux Nation and the Lakota's ownership of the Sacred

  government negotiated a peace by conceding everything demanded by
  the enemy.

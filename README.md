### Great Law of Peace (and the U.S. Constitution)

Some historians, including Donald Grinde of the University at Buffalo,
The State University of New York, have claimed that the democratic
ideals of the Gayanashagowa provided a significant inspiration to
Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and other framers of the
U.S. Constitution. They contend that the federal structure of the
U.S. constitution was influenced by the living example of the Iroquois
confederation, as were notions of individual liberty and the
separation of powers. [more...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Law_of_Peace#Influence_on_the_United_States_Constitution)

### [Hempstead Project Heart](https://www.hempsteadprojectheart.org/)

Founded by legendary Native poet, philosopher and recording artist
John Trudell, Hempstead Project HEART is a vehicle to build public
awareness of the many benefits of growing Industrial Hemp. With a team
of committed volunteers at his side, notably Anna Owen, Linda Delair
and Lea Walters, John built Hempstead Project HEART to be a driving
force to grow the hemp economy in America. From speaking at public
events to organizing with the California State Grange on Industrial
Hemp advocacy, John and his Hempstead Project HEART team laid
important groundwork for public acceptance of hemp in California. In
November 2016, California re-legalized Industrial Hemp as a commercial
agricultural crop. This huge step demonstrates the importance of
education and action in creating positive
change. [more...](https://www.hempsteadprojectheart.org/our-story)

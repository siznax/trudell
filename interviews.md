> As eager as I was to talk to Trudell about “AKA Grafitti Man,” one
> of that year’s most notable recordings, I did not relish having to

> did not flinch. He was a warrior who would not let even the deaths
> of those closest to him to deter him from his mission; and he was a
> poet-shaman who found strength putting his and his people’s pain
> into words.

Help me build a library to honor and amplify John Trudell's life and
message at https://github.com/siznax/trudell.

To my knowledge, no one has collected the works of John Trudell—radio
broadcasts, interviews, articles, letters, poems, music, performances,
speeches, and talks—other than by fragmentary uploads to social media,
personal blogs, some commercial websites, and public reporting.

I am archiving much of this material, organizing it, and will attempt
to present in such a way as **to amplify John Trudell's voice and
powerful words, and to make them freely available forever to
everyone**. This would not include his commercially viable output, 
which this library would seek to promote for the benefit of his
estate.

However, archiving John Trudell's life and work is not enough. I am
also archiving everything John Trudell and his family struggled
against, including the known (oral and documented) history of the
indigenous people of Turtle Island (North America) since the arrival
of Europeans.

I am gathering and organizing material on GitHub because is easy to
use, free, accessible, reliable, durable, and capacious. However,
GitHub is still a commercial enterprise with all of the attendant
vulnerabilities. Therefore, all documents and media there will be
uploaded/copied to a new collection at a non-government archive which
has a mandate to preserve, maintain, and make available this
collection to the public for free, for ever.

I claim no right to do this other than that of free speech. I am only
a strongly like-minded human (and coincidental technologist). I was
born in the U.S. but I am partly of European descent and not a member
of a tribe. However, **John Trudell's life and words have changed my
understanding of the world and what I choose to do with my time
here.**

**I am seeking guidance and participation** from friends of John
Trudell, tribal members, and like-minded people everywhere. If there
is a better way to preserve, contextualize, and amplify his voice,
please contact me. I would very much like to help because
non-indigenous people continue to do great harm to the indigenous, so
**it is critical to help the non-indigenous to understand** that.

With indigenous guidance and participation, I know that we can build
an independent "American Indian" collection that far exceeds the
quality, accessibility, impact, and durability of vulnerable personal
collections on commercial platforms like Facebook and YouTube,
official records retained by governments, or even Trudell's
commercially available products. I also know that honoring John
Trudell's life and work with a dedicated library would be of
tremendous benefit to this world, especially now, in the wake of the
brutal killing of George Floyd and the subsequent hightened awareness
of persistent white supremacist forces at work in this country.

I propose this collection be the basis for a new library to be named
in honor of John Trudell and his family for their contributions to
indigenous people everywhere. My hope is that announcing the library
could be an occasion for a pow wow where selections from Trudell’s
1983 album _Tribal Voice_ may be performed live with a drum group and
speakers selected to read his poems.

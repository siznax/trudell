My object in pi|blMMg th| ''Red M|n ? p Rebuke" of the tiark of the white birch 
tree, is out of loyalty to my own people, [knfl gratitude t| the Great Spirit, who in his 
wisdom provided fir our use for infold iterations, thi| most'remarkable tree with 
manifold b*k usecl by us insteafl of papel being of grlater value to us as it cotild 
not be injured by sun or water. j ' 

t Out of the bark of thfc wonderful tree were made hats, caps and d|shes for do- 
mestic use, while our mJdens tied with it thd kilot that sealed their tijarriage vow; 
wifewams were- made of if, as wellks large canbes that outrode the vioielt storms on 
lake and;sea; it was also used for light and fuel ajt our wax; councils and spirit dances. 
Originallf thJ scores of our northern lakes and sjreams wcafe fringed with it and ever- 
green, and thl White charmingly contrasted with the greenf mirrorecfjfrom the water 
was Indeed beautiful, but lik(f the red fnan this tree is vanishing from our forests, 

"Alas for jis ; ou| day is o'er

THE RED MAN'S REBUKE. 



BY SIMON POKAGON 

I Pottawattamie Chief. 



- 



"Shall not one line lament our forest race, 
For you struck out from wild creation's face ? 
Freedom —the selfsame freedom you adore, 
Bade us defend our violated shore." 



In behalf of my people, the American Indians, I hereby declare to yqu f 
the pale-faced race that has usurped our lands and homes,^ that we have no 
spirit t6 celebrate with you the great Columbian Fair now being held in this 
Chicago city, the wonder of the WQrld. 

No ; sooner would we hold high joy-day over the graves of our departed 
fathers, than to celebrate our own funeral, the discovery of America. And 
while you who are strangers, and you who live here, bring the offerings of the 

I

I 



i 



handiwork of your own lands, and your hearts in admiration rejoice over the 
beauty and grandeur of this young republic, and you say, * 4 Behold the won- 
ders wrought by our children in this foreign land," do not forget that this 
success has been at the sacrifice of our homes and a once happy race* 

Where these great Columbian show-buildings stretch skyward, and where 
stands this " Queen City of the West," once stood the red man's wigwam; 
here met their old mten, young men, and maidens ; here blazed their council- 
fires. But now the eagle's eye can find no trace of them. Here was the center of 
their wide-spread hunting-grounds ; stretching far eastward, and to the great 
salt Gulf southward, and to thfe lofty Rocky Mountain chain westward ; and all 
about and beyond the Great Lakes northward roamed vast herds of buffalo 
that no man could number, while moose, deer, and elk were found from 
ocean to ocean ; pigeons, ducks, and geese in near bow-shot moved in great 
clouds through the air, while fish swarmed our streams* lakes, and seas close 
to shore. All were provided by the Great Spirit for our use ; we destroyed 
none except for food and dress ; had plenty and were contented and happy. 

But alaSjjj! tie pale-faces came by chance to our shores, many times very 
needy and hungry. We nursed and fed them, — fed the ravens that were soon 
t6 Jpluck out our eyes, and the eyes of our children ; for no sooner had the 
news reached the Old World that a new continent had been found, peopled 



with Imother race pi m|n, than, locust-like, they swailfeB on all out 'coasts | 



■ and, like the cprioji cro|vs in spring, that in cinfles wheel and clarW tyig and 
I loud, and wilJnot cease until they find akd feaslj upoh th<| dea<y.so th*se 
strangerl from the East long circuits made 1 , and turkey-like thev gobbled in 
our ears, 1 " Qiv^ us gold, give uslgold ; " Where fix^i you gold ? \ Whfere fina 

lyou gold I "V | | l I 

We gave for |romis|s and "gewgaws" all tfie gold |we fe4'A n « 4 lowed , 
them Jvhere to dig for more|; to| repay jus, they robbed) our hoihis of fath- ( 
ers, mothers, sons, and daughters; some were foraed across fhe|s<|a f<Jr . 
slaves in Spain, awhile multitudes were dragged intd th<j mines to jdjg for! 
gol4 and held ill slavery! there untillalljwho escaped not, died under the 
lash^of the cruel task-maler. It' finally passedjinto their hjstory that, "the 
red man if tHp iWest, unite the blalk man of the Ealt, (will die tfefc^re lie '11 
tL a slave!" O* hearts were crushed by such base ingratitude ; and, ai the 
United States has nojv decreed, " No Chinaman |hall land upon oi£ stoles," 
so we then felt that no such barbarians as they, should.land orl ou\s- I 

In those days that tried ov| fathersi sonls, tradition) says^: "A crippled, 
pey-haired sire told his tribe that injtheVisilns oftthe night hf was lifted high 
}bov| the eaith, and in great wondel beheld a vast spider-web spread out c^fer 
e llnd from the Atlantic Ocean towjfcd the (setting sun. It^ network w^

made of rods of iron ; along its lines in all directions rushed monstrous spiders, 
greater in strength, ahdl larger far than any beast of epxth, clad in brass and 
iron, dragging after thejn long rows of wigwams with families therein, out- 
stripping in their course the flight of birdfe that fled before th^m. Hissing 
from their npstrils came forth fire and smoke, striking terror to both fowl and 
beast. The red men hid themselves in fear, or .fled away, while the wMte men 
trained these monsters fqr the war path, as warriors for battle." J 1 I 

The old msm who; saw thi vision claimed it meant that the Indian race 
would surely pass idway before the pahs-facefl strangers. He died a 
martyr to his belief. Centuries have passed since that time, and we now be- 
hold in the vision as in a mirror, the present net-work of railroads, and the 
monstrous engines with their fire, smoke, and hissing gteam, With cars attached, 
a£ they go sweeping through Jpe land. | fr i t 

The cyclone of civilization rolled westward ; the forests of tmtold centu- 
ries Were swept away; streams dried up ; lakes fell back frdm their ancient 
bounds ; and all our fathers once loved to g&ze upo^i wa$ destroyed, defaced^ 
or marred, except the sun, moon, and starry skies above, which the Great 
Spirit in his wisdom hting beyond their reach. 

Still on the storm-cloud rolled, while before its lightning and thunder the 
beasts of the field ' and the fowls of the air withered like grass before thq 




flame — were shot for love of power to kill alone, and left to spoil upon the 
plains. Their bleaching bones now scattered far and near, in shame declare 
the wanton cruelty of pale-faced men. The storm unsatisfied on land swept 
our lakes and streams, while before its clouds of hooks, nets, and glistening 
spears the fish vanished from our waters like the morning dew before the 
rising sun. Thus our inheritance was cut off, and we were driven and scattered 
as sheep before the wolves. ^%^»-jpipi-iii^-'»^ 
^*?i*or was this all. They brought among us fatal diseases our fathers knew 
not of ; our medicine-men tried in vain to check the deadly plague ; but they 
themselves died, and our people fell as fall the leaves before the autumn's 
blast. To be just, we must acknowledge there were some good men with these 
strangers, who gave their lives for ours, and in greatfjadness taught us the 
revealed will of the Great Spirit through his Son Jesus, the mediator between 
God and mo - But while we were being taught tff^g the Lord our God with 
all our heart, mind, and strength, and our neighbors as ourselves, and ourchil- 
dren were taught to lisp, "Qur Father who art in heaven> haHowed be thy 
name," bad men of the same race, whom we thought of the same belief 
shocked our faith in the revealed will of the Father, as they came among us 
with bitter Oftthj upon their lips, something we had never heard before, and 
cups of "fire-water" in their hands, somethinfi^ we Had n^r seeQ before. 




They pressed the sparkling glasses to our lips and said," Drink, and you will be 
happy. M We drank thereof, we and our children, but alas ! like the serpent 
that charms to kill, the drink-habit coiled about the heart-strings of its victims, 
shocking unto death, friendship, love, honor, manhood — all that makes men 
good and noble ; crushing out all ambition, and leaving naught but a culprit 
vagabond in the place of a man. 

Now as we have been taught -.-to believe that our first parents ate of the for- 
idden fruit, and fell, so we as fully believe that this fire-water is tK *mfettfl- 
cider of the white man's devil, made from ^^Cnd^C^hat tree thatJ^a^St 6 
death into the world, and all our woes. The arrow, the scalping-knife, and 
the tomahawk used on the war-path were merciful compared with it ^ they 
were used in our def eSe/ W accursed drink came like a serpent m the 
form of a dove. Many of our people partook of it without mistrust, as 
children pluck the flowers and clutch a scorpion in their g^ip ; only when 
they feel the sting, they let the flowers fall. But Nature's .children -ha^yjft 
such power ; for when the viper's fangs they felt, they onljphuggcd the reptile 
the more closely to their breasts, while friends before them stood pleading 
with prayers and tears that they would let the deadly serpent drop* But all 
in vain. Although they promised so to do, yet with laughing grin and steps 
uncertain like the fool, they still more frequently guzzled VfiWn this hellish

but in return they most treacherously seized and bound in chains the unsuspecting natives; 
and as a ransom for their release, demanded large sums^oJLgpld v/hich were soon given by 
their subjects. But instead of granting them freedom as promised, they were put to death in a 
most shocking manner. Their subjects were titfh hunted down like wild beasts, with blood-

thus leaving them poor and naked. I also find you guilty of following the 
trail of Christian missionaries into the wilderness among the natives, and when 
they had set up my altars, and the great work of redemption had just begun, 
and some in faith believed, you then and there most wickedly set up the idol 
of man-tchyft^in-to (the devil), and there stuck out your sign, SAMPLE 
ROOMS. You then dealt out to the *ons of the forest a most damnable drug, 
fitly termed on earth by Christian women, a beverage of hell, 1 which de- 
stroyed both body and soul, taking therefore, all their money and blankets, and 
scrupling not to take in pawn the Bibles given them by my servants.

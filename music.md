John Trudell (February 15, 1946 – December 8, 2015) was an acclaimed
poet, national recording artist, actor and activist whose
international following reflects the universal language of his words,
work and message. Trudell (Santee Sioux) was a spokesperson for the
Indian of All Tribes occupation of Alcatraz Island from 1969 to
1971. He then worked with the American Indian Movement (AIM), serving
as Chairman of AIM from 1973 to 1979. In February of 1979, a fire of
unknown origin killed Trudell’s wife, three children and
mother-in-law. It was through this horrific tragedy that Trudell began
to find his voice as an artist and poet, writing, in his words, “to
stay connected to this reality.”

### John Trudell's Musical career

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Trudell#Musical_career

> In 1979, Trudell met musical artist and activist Jackson Browne and
> became more interested in the musical world (and recording albums
> and performing his own compositions in live venues).
> 
> Trudell recorded an album A.K.A Grafitti Man ("graffiti" was
> misspelled in the title) with Kiowa guitarist Jesse Ed Davis that
> was originally available on cassette tape format only. This comports
> with the practice common to American indigenous and other so-called
> minorities of distributing music mixtapes captured live at group
> events and copied and distributed through non-commercial channels,
> like those of the San Francisco-based rock group Grateful Dead,
> Native American powwow music performances in general, and African
> American gatherings whence came the expression Each One Teach One,
> common also to an emerging grassroots movement that was arguably
> itself a response to the reactionary madness of slavery and/or
> military-industrial/imperialist hegemony flourishing in the 1980s.
> 
> In 1990, he took part in Tony Hymas's Oyaté project.
> 
> In 1992, Trudell remade and re-released A.K.A Grafitti Man as an
> audio CD to substantial critical and popular acclaim.
> 
> Arguably his greatest musical success came with the 1994 album
> Johnny Damas & Me that was described as "a culmination of years of
> poetic work, and an example of a process of fusing traditional
> sounds, values, and sensibilities with thought-provoking lyrics,
> this time with urgent rock and roll."[20]
> 
> Other musical releases (many with his band Bad Dog) include A.K.A
> Grafitti Man (1986), Heart Jump Bouquet (1987), Blue Indians (1999),
> Descendant Now Ancestor (2001), Bone Days (2001), Live A Fip (2003),
> Madness and The Moremes (2007), Crazier Than Hell (2010), Wazi's
> Dream (2015).
> 
> Popular Music critic Neal Ullestad said of Trudell's live
> performances, "This isn't simply pop rock with Indian drums and
> chants added. It's integrated rock and roll by an American Indian
> with a multicultural band directed to anyone who will listen."[20]
> 
> The closing sequence of Alanis Obomsawin's 2014 documentary film
> Trick or Treaty? is set to Trudell's song "Crazy Horse."[21]

Foreword
----------------

This report represents a compilation and new analysis of data on
the effects and consequences of violent crime among American
Indians.  The report uses data from a wide variety of sources,
including statistical series maintained by the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS), the FBI, and the Bureau of the Census.  Data
are reported from American Indian crime victims on how they were
affected by the victimization and about who victimized them. The
report also includes the first BJS estimates of the total number
of American Indians under the custody or supervision of the
justice system.

The findings reveal a disturbing picture of American Indian
involvement in crime as both victims and offenders.  The rate of
violent victimization estimated from responses by American
Indians is well above that of other U.S. racial or ethnic
subgroups and is more than twice as high as the national
average.  This disparity in the rates of violence affecting
American Indians occurs across age groups, housing locations,
income groups, and sexes.

With respect to the offender, two findings are perhaps most
notable:  American Indians are more likely than people of other
races to experience violence at the hands of someone of a
different race, and the criminal victimizer is more likely to
have consumed alcohol preceding the offense.  However, the
victim/offender relationships of American Indians parallel that
of all victims of violence.

On a given day, an estimated 1 in 25 American Indians age 18 or
older is under the jurisdiction of the criminal justice system
-- 2.4 times the per capita rate of whites and 9.3 times the per
capita rate of Asians.  But black Americans, with a per capita
rate nearly double that of American Indians, are more likely to
be under the care or custody of correctional authorities.

This report is the first step in a vigorous BJS effort to
document issues of crime and justice affecting American Indians.
Statistical programs have been instituted to learn more about
tribal criminal justice agencies, such as law enforcement and
confinement facilities, and these will complement data available
from other BJS series covering the justice system.

This study was prepared as a resource to respond to frequent
inquiries.  Since the number of American Indians in our annual
samples are inadequate to provide definitive statistics, this
report cumulates data from over a 5-year period.  I hope that
this report will serve as a foundation for other reports and
discussions about how best to address the problem of crime
affecting this segment of our population.

BJS has undertaken improvements in the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS), designed to improve future data
collection on crime and its consequences for American Indians.
This year BJS enhanced the NCVS to permit future analyses to
report statistics on victimizations occurring on tribal lands.
In addition, victim descriptions of the offender were modified
to permit greater precision in future statistics about the
victim's perceptions of the offender's race.  Together, these
NCVS upgrades will result in much greater detail about both
locations of crime incidents and perpetrators.  

Valuable contributions to the report were made by Norena Henry,
Director of the American Indian/Alaska Native Affairs in the
Office of Justice Programs, and Melvinda Pete, a BJS university
student intern.  In the development of the report, they helped
to provide context for the statistical findings.

Measuring criminal victimization
among American Indians


American Indians have higher per capita rates of violent
criminal victimization than whites, blacks, or Asians 
in the United States, according to data from the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS).

Population estimates from the Bureau of the Census for July 1,
1998, indicate that American Indians account for just under 1%
of the U.S. population:

     All races       270,029,000   100.0%

American Indian*       2,357,000     0.9
White                222,932,000    82.6
Black                 34,370,000    12.7
Asian                 10,370,000     3.8

 *In this report the term American Indian refers to Alaska
Natives, Aleuts, and American Indians.  The term Asian
encompasses Asians, Hawaiian Natives, and Pacific Islanders.

Two demographic factors distinguish American Indians 
from other racial groups:  in 1998 the median age of 
the American Indian population is nearly 8 years younger
than the U.S. resident population, and American Indians are the
most likely to report Hispanic ethnicity.

                     Median       Percent
Race                 age          Hispanic

     All races          35.2 years  11.3%

Black                   29.9         5.0
Asian                   31.2         5.8

This report presents data on the rates and characteristics of
violent crimes, including murder, experienced by American
Indians.  Information is alsoprovided on American Indians in the
criminal justice system.


Violent crime that American Indians
reported to the National Crime 
Victimization Survey


The NCVS collects information on the Nation's experience with
crime. It also collects information on the race of the victim
and the race of the offender as reported by the victim.

The NCVS provides estimates of the violent crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and assault for persons age 12 or
older.  During 1992-96 the NCVS found that American Indians
experienced an average of almost 150,000 violent crimes per year
from among the estimated 10.8 million violent crimes occurring
on average per year among all racial groups.  Victimization data
for 1996 indicate that American Indians accounted for about 1.4%
of all violent victimizations that year, about the same
percentage as in preceding years.

American Indian tribes 
in the United States, 1996


The indigenous peoples in the United States have 550 
Federally recognized tribes that have a distinct history 
and culture and often a separate language.

The average annual violent crime rate among American 
Indians -- 124 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older --
is about 2 1/2 times the national rate (table 1).

Note:  The NCVS estimates of the racial distribution of the resident 
population age 12 or older for the period 1992-96 correspond closely 
to the estimates reported by the Bureau of the Census in their P-25 
series of population estimates.  The NCVS estimate shows that American 
Indians represented 0.6% of those interviewed while the P-25 estimate 
shows that American Indians account for 0.8% of the resident population 
age 12 or older.

and twice that for blacks.  The rate of robbery experienced by 
American Indians (12 per 1,000) was similar to that of black 
residents (13 per 1,000) (table 3).

For the 1992-96 period, the average annual per capita rate of
violent victimization translates into about 1 violent crime for
every 20 residents age 12 or older.  Substantial variation,
however, was evident by race.  American Indians experienced
about 1 violent crime for every 8 residents age 12 or older
compared to 1 violent victimization for every 16 black
residents, 1 for every 20 white residents, and 1 for every 34
Asian residents.

Types of violent crime

The Nation's population of American Indians age 12 or older
experienced an annual average of 126,400 simple and aggravated
assaults, 14,800 robberies, and 8,400 rapes or sexual assaults
during 1992-96.

The types of violent crimes experienced by American Indians were
generally similar to that found across the Nation (table 4). 
The most common type of violent crime experienced by American
Indian victims was simple assault (56%).

Among all the violent crimes reported by American Indians, 28%
were  aggravated assault, 10% robbery, and 6% rape/sexual
assault.  Asian and black victims of violence were more likely
than American Indian or white victims to have reported a
robbery. 


Sex, age, and location of residence of 
victims of violent crime 


The violent crime rate among American Indian males was 153 per
1,000 males age 12 or older, more than double that found among
all males (60 per 1,000 age 12 or older) (table 5).  The violent
crime rate for American Indian females during this period was 98
per 1,000 females, a rate higher than that found among white
females (40 per 1,000) or black females (56 per 1,000).

Among the different age groups, violent crime rates were highest
(232 per 1,000 persons) for American Indians age 18 to 24.  This
violent crime rate was more than twice that found among whites
and blacks of the same age.

About 40% of American Indians reside in rural areas, compared to
18% of whites and 8% of blacks.  The violent crime rate for
American Indians was highest for those in urban areas, 207 per
1,000, and lowest for those in ruralareas, 89 per 1,000. 
However, this rural crime rate for American Indians is more than
double that found among rural whites (37 per 1,000) or blacks
(33 per 1,000).  The urban crime ratefor American Indians is
more than 3 times that found among urban whites.

About half (52%) of the violent crimes committed against
American Indians occurred among those age 12 to 24 years (table
6).  Two percent of the violent crimes committed against
American Indians were against the elderly, age 55 or older.

Nearly 6 in 10 of the violent crimes experienced by American
Indians had been committed against males, similar to the
national distribution.

In 1995 the Bureau of Census reported 2.2 million American
Indians and Alaska Natives residing in the United States, about
1.94 million of whom were American Indians.

In 1990 over half of American Indians and Alaska Natives lived
in 10 States: 

Oklahoma       252,000

American Indians with incomes under $10,000 had the 
highest rate of violent victimization, 182 per 1,000.
At every income category American Indians had a 
higher rate of violent victimization than persons of
other races.

Victim-offender relationship


Overall, strangers were reported to have committed 46% of the
violent crimes against American Indians (table 8).

involved offenders with whom the victim had a prior
relationship.  About 1 in 6 violent victimizations among
American Indians involved an offender who was an intimate or
family member to the victim, about the same as for victims 
of all races.

Race of offender

Violent crime against white or black victims is primarily
intraracial.  Among white victims of violence, 69% of offenders
were white (table 9).  Likewise, black victims of violence were
most likely to have been victimized by a black offender (81%).

Note: Table excludes an estimated 420,793 victims of violence
(3.9% of all victims) who could not describe the offender's race.

--------------------------------------------------- 

The NCVS classifies as "other race" those offenders whom victims
perceive to be Asian or American Indian.  However, based 
on self-reports of offender race, it is clear that
American Indians and Asians, when victimized by violence, 
were the most likely to report that the offender was
from a different race.

The majority (60%) of American Indian victims of violent crime
described the offender as white, and nearly 30% of the offenders
were likely to have been other American Indians.  An estimated
10% of offenders were described as black.  


The less serious the offense, the higher was the percentage of
American Indian victims of violence describing the offender as
"other race" (table 10).        

---------------------------------------------------

American Indian victims of rape/sexual assault most
often reported that the victimization involved an
offender of a different race.  About 9 in 10
American Indian victims of rape or sexual assault
were estimated to have had assailants who were white
or black.

Two-thirds of more of the American Indian victims of
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault
described the offender as belonging to a different
race.

---------------------------------------------------

----------------------------
Intimate and family violence
---------------------------

Intimate and family violence each account for about 9% of all
violent victimizations experienced by American Indian victims,
about the same percentage as found among all victims of
violence.  

Most striking among American Indian victims of violence is the
substantial difference in the racial composition of offenders in
intimate violence incidents when contrasted with family
violence.  Among violence victims of all races, about 11% of
intimate victims and 5% of family victims report the offender to
have been of a different race; however, among American Indian
victims of violence, 75% of the intimate victimizations and
25% of the family victimizations involved an offender of a 
different race. 

Overall, weapons were used in less than a fifth of the violence
involving an intimate or family member.

Intimate and family violence involve a comparatively high level
of alcohol and drug use by offenders as perceived by victims -as
is the case for Indian and non-Indian victims.  Indian victims
of intimate and family violence, however, are more likely than
others to be injured and need hospital care.

Note: Intimate violence refers to victimizations involving
current and former spouses, boyfriends, and girlfriends.
Family violence refers to victimizations involving spouses
and other relatives.  Alcohol-involved incidents included
only those incidents in which the victim felt that he/she
could determine whether the offender had been using drugs
or alcohol.

-----------------------------------------------


Alcohol, drugs, and crime 


Alcohol and drug use was a factor in more than half of violent
crimes against American Indians (table 11).

Note: Table excludes those respondents who were unable to
report whether or not they perceived the offender to have been
using drugs or alcohol.

---------------------------------------------------


Substantial differences can be found by race in the reports of
victims of violence of their perceptions of drug and alcohol use
by offenders.  Among those who could describe alcohol or drug
use by offenders, American Indian victims of violence were the
most likely to report such perceived use by the offender.

Overall, in 55% of American Indian violent victimizations, the
victim said the offender was under the influence of alcohol,
drugs, or both.  The offender's use of alcohol and/or drugs was
somewhat less likely in violent crimes committed against whites
(44%) or blacks (35%).

-------------------------------------------------------------
Offenders' use of alcohol and drugs reported by American Indian 
victims of violence varied with the race of the offender: 
Intraracial violence was more likely to involve a drinking
offender while  interracial violence involved higher levels of
offender drug use.    

According to American Indian victims of violence, offender  
use of alcohol was a factor in nearly two-thirds of the 
violent  victimizations in which the offender
was neither white nor black.

An estimated 3 in 4 American Indian victims of family violence
reported that they perceived the offender to have been drinking
at the time of the offense.  About half the persons of all races
who were victims of family violence reported a drinking offender.

Location of violent crime


Just over 40% of American Indian victims of violence reported
that the incident occurred in or around their own home or that
of a friend, relative, or neighbor (table 13). This is higher
than the approximately one-third of violent victimizations
reported by victims of all races to have occurred at or near a
home.

Nineteen percent of violent victimizations against American
Indians took place in open areas, on the street or on public
transportation.  Fewer than 1 in 10 violent crimes were reported 
to have occurred at school.

---------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Time of occurrence

Half of the violent crimes committed against 
American Indians occurred after dark.
About 1 in 5 of the violent victimizations
took place between midnight and 6 a.m.

Crime in the workplace


On average nearly 2 million violent crimes occurred in the 
workplace every year.  The workplace accounted for about 
1 in 5 violent crimes experienced by the public.
 
Among American Indians about 14% of the violent victimizations
were reported to have occurred in the workplace.
About 1 in 4 employed American Indian victims of violence
said that the incident occurred in the workplace.

Weapons used in violent crime

In about a third of the violent crime incidents American Indian
victims were faced with an offender who had a weapon (table 16).

About 13% of the crimes involved an offender with a firearm.
In almost 70% of the violent crime incidents, the American
Indian victim resisted the offender, most frequently through the
use of physical force (table 17).  American Indian victims used
a weapon in self-defense in less than 3% of the violent
incidents committed against them.

Injury rates, hospitalization, 
and financial loss


American Indian victims of a violent crime were more likely to
have been injured than were white or Asian crime victims. Nearly
a third of the American Indian violent crime victims were
injured during the incident (table 18).  About a quarter of all
violence victims of all races were injured during the incident.

Detail may not add to total because of rounding.

--------------------------------------------------- 


As a result of their victimizations, an estimated 18% of
American Indian victims of violence sustained bruises, the most
commonly reported injury.  Among those injured, about half
received some kind of medical treatment -- a third at the
hospital. 

Seventy-one percent of American Indian crime victims who were
injured during the incident and sought medical treatment had
medical insurance or qualified for public medical benefits.  


Injured American Indian victims of violence who sought treatment
for their injuries were as likely as other racial groups to have
some form of coverage for medical benefits.

Victims of violence were asked to report the value of losses
associated with the violence they experienced.  These losses
could include medical expenses, property lost or damaged, and
pay lost by missing work.


About 1 in 4 American Indian victims 
of violence suffered an economic loss as a consequence of the
victimization.  The average per-victim loss among American
Indian victims of violence reporting a loss was $936 (table 19).

The total annual loss for American Indians arising from violent
criminal victimization translates into more than $35 million
(table 20).  The losses reported by American Indian victims of
violence largely resulted from medical expenses that accounted
for more than $21 million.

Child abuse and neglect


In the United States from 1992 to 1995, American Indians and Asians
were the only racial or ethnic groups to experience increases in the rate
of abuse or neglect of children under age 15, as measured by incidents
recorded by child protective service agencies.
 
The increase in reported incidents involving American Indian children
was more than 3 times as large as that for Asian children.  The per capita
rate for American Indian children was 7 times that of Asian children.

because they account for at least 80% of the victims of child abuse and neglect.

Each year the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System of
the Department of Health and Human Services obtains from child
protective service agencies nationwide the number of reports of
alleged maltreatment of children.  Published data for 1995
indicate that about 1 million children were substantiated to
have been victims of neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse,
emotional maltreatment, medical neglect, or other forms of
verified maltreatment.

Source: National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System

Non-Hispanic American Indians accounted for just under 2% of the
victims of child abuse/neglect in  reports collected nationwide
in 1995.  There is evidence that their share has been
increasing.  Non-Hispanic American Indians, who accounted for
just under 1% of the population age 14 or younger, were
overrepresented twofold as victims of child abuse.

On a per capita basis, 1995 data indicate about 1 substantiated
report of a child victim of abuse or neglect for every 30
American Indian children age 14 or younger.  

Nationwide, the 1995 rates translate into about 1 child victim
of maltreatment known to a child protective services agency for
every -
-- 58 children of any race
-- 66 white children
-- 30 black children
-- 209 Asian children 
-- 80 Hispanic children

Reporting violent crime 
to the police

Forty-five percent of American Indian victims of violent crime
reported the crime to the police (table 22). This level of crime
reporting was similar to that found among white (41%) and black
(50%) violent crime victims.  

----------------------------------------------------

American Indians differ little from other racial groups in their
reporting of violent crime to the police or in the likelihood that
the victim knows of the arrest of the offender.

Table 22
 
                       Average annual number of victimizations
                       10,785,800

-------------------------------------------------


Among victims not reporting the crime to the police, the reasons
that persons of different racial backgrounds had for not
reporting were also similar.  Nearly half of both American
Indians not reporting the violent crime to the police and
victims of all races who did not report  the violence to the
police said that they considered the matter private or too minor
to bother the police (table 23).

Race and ethnicity 
in violent victimization 


The NCVS asks respondents about both race and ethnicity.  For
1992-96 about 9% of all participants, or about 18.5 million
residents age 12 or older in an average year, were of Hispanic
origin and belonged to one of the four primary racial groups
sampled in the survey-- white, black, American Indian, or Asian.
Hispanic residents were estimated to consist of 17.8 million
whites, 0.5 million blacks, about 0.1 million Asians, and a
slightly smaller number of American Indians.

Across each racial group, Hispanic residents were found to have
higher average per capita rates of violent victimization.  Among
all racial and ethnic groups, non-Hispanic Asians were found to
have the lowest estimated rates of violent victimization, about
1 violent crime for every 36 residents.  By contrast, American
Indian residents who also identified themselves as Hispanic
reported a rate of violent victimization that translated into
about 1 violent crime for every 4 residents.

 * While about 7% of all American Indian participants in the
NCVS reported they were also of Hispanic ethnicity, nearly 14%
of those American Indians victimized by violence were of
Hispanic origin.

 * Among American Indians who also described themselves as
Hispanic, the rate of violent victimization was 4 times the rate
found among all Hispanics and twice the rate found among
non-Hispanic American Indians.

Annual number of murders of American Indians, 1976-96


Murder among American Indians

Each year about 150 American Indians become murder victims.
Little year-to-year variation occurred in the number of American
Indian murder victims, but recent years were below the peak
number reached in 1986.  

American Indians were 0.7% of all murder victims nationwide,
about the same as their share of the population  (table 26).
From 1976 to 1996 an estimated 3,100 American Indians were
murdered.  Due to variations in reporting by law enforcement
agencies over time, detail on these murder victims is available
for 2,826 American Indian murder victims or about 92% of the
total estimated number of victims.

---------------------------------------------------

Over the 21-year period, just under 14% of the murders of
American Indians occurred in California, proportional to
California's share of the American Indian population.  Alaska,
by contrast, accounts for about 10% of American Indian murder
victims over the period but just over 4% of the American Indian
population nationwide.  In Alaska, 1976-96, American Indians and
Alaska Natives composed about 16% of the population but 28% of
that State's murder victims.  The 10 States in which about 63%
of the American Indian population reside have accounted for
about 75% of the murders.

--------------------
Rates of murder
--------------------

As observed across the other racial groups, the number of
murders per capita among American Indians has been declining.
The rate of murder among American Indians in 1996 was below the
national average for ages under age 40 (table 27).  For ages 40
or older, murder rates are close to the national average.

*Increases occurred from 4 additional murders of persons age 40 to 49
and 4 additional murders of persons age 50 or older.  Denominators
for the oldest group included persons age 50 to 74 years.

---------------------------------------------------

For persons age 24 or younger in 1996, American Indian rates of
murder closely paralleled the rates among whites and Asians and
were well below the rates among black victims.  For those age 25
to 29, the 37% decline in the rate of murder among American
Indians reflects the largest decline of any racial group.



Circumstances of murder


Supplemental data regarding murders with known circumstances
indicate that American Indian murder victims were more likely to
have been killed during a brawl involving alcohol or drugs
(13%)than white (6%), black (4%), or Asian (2%) murder victims
(table 28).  Forty-five percent of American Indian murder
victims were killed during an argument, and 11% were killed
during the commission of a violent felony.

Victim-offender relationship 
in murder cases

In American Indian murder cases in which the victim
offender-relationship was known, strangers accounted for
approximately 16% of the murders (table 29).  Acquaintances
accounted for about half the murders.  Victim-offender relations
in American Indian murder cases were similar to those found
among all murders.

---------------------------------------------------

American Indian and Asian murder victims were more likely than
white or black murder victims to have been killed by a stranger
of a different race.


Race of murderers

In most murder cases involving a white or black victim, the
offender was of the same race as the victim (table 30). However,
when the races of the offender and victim were known, more than
40% of American Indian murder victims were killed by an offender
who was not an American Indian; in 33% of the cases the offender
was white.

Compared to all murder victims, American Indian
murder victims were substantially less likely
to have been killed by a handgun but more likely
to have been killed by a rifle or shotgun or stabbed.

handgun.  Almost 30% of American Indian murder victims were
killed by a knife, compared to less than 20% of all murders.



Arrests and convictions 
of American Indians

Arrest data for 1996, provided by local law enforcement
agencies, indicate that American Indians account for 0.9% of the
arrests for Part I violent crimes (murder and nonnegligent
manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) --
an estimated 6,600 arrests for these offenses.  

Approximately 17% of American Indians arrested for these violent
offenses are under age 18, nearly the same percentage found
among arrestees for all violent crimes in 1996.  The 1996 arrest
rates for Part I violent crimes among American Indian youth were
about the same as for white youth and were about a fifth of
those of black youth.

   
-------------------------------------------------

Unlike the pattern of violent crime arrest rates for other
racial groups -- higher for youth than for the whole population
-- among American Indians the arrest rates for those under age
18 did not vary from the overall rate.

American Indians have a rate of arrest for alcohol violations
(DUI, liquor law violations, and public drunkenness) more 
than double the national rate.  Arrests of American Indians 
under age 18 for alcohol-related violations are also twice 
the national average.

Felony convictions in State courts


On average there are annually about 900,000 felony convictions
in State courts.  American Indians account for just over 1/2 
of 1% of felony convictions across the Nation (table 32).

Note:  The annual average estimates are based on the National
Judicial Reporting Program, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996.          



In 1996 State and local felony courts throughout the United
States convicted an estimated 1 million defendants.  Among these
were an estimated 7,000 felony convictions of American Indians,
a rate of approximately 1 felony conviction for every 200
American Indians age 18 or older.  By contrast in 1996 whites
experienced a felony conviction rate of about 1 conviction per
300 adults; among blacks the rate of felony conviction was 1 for
every 51 adults; and Asians reflected the lowest rate, about 1
felony conviction for every 600 Asian residents age 18 or older.


American Indians under 
correctional supervision


American Indians accounted for about 1% of the more than 5.7
million adults under correctional care, custody, or control on a
single day in 1997 (table 33). The estimated 62,600 American
Indians with a correctional status accounted for just over 4% of
the American Indian adult population (not shown in a table).

---------------------------------------------------  

By comparison, an estimated 2% of white adults, 10% of black
adults, and less than a half of 1% of Asian adults were under
correctional supervision (not shown in a table). 

In 1997, 54% of the American Indians under correctional
supervision were in the community -- on probation (47%) or
parole (7%).  Twenty-five percent were held in local jails, 18%
in State prisons, and 3% in Federal prisons.

-------------------------------------------------

In 1997 just under half of the American Indian offenders under
the care, custody, or control of Federal, State, or local
correctional authorities were confined in prisons or jails.  By
contrast, less than a third of correctional populations
nationwide were confined in prisons or jails.

----------------------------------------------------

American Indians comprised just over  1% of the offenders on
probation or parole or in State or Federal prisons but an
estimated 2.9% of persons in local jails nationwide.  American
Indians accounted for 2.5% of those detained in local jails who
had not been convicted of crimes and 3% of the convicted
offenders in jail serving shorter sentences or awaiting transfer
to other institutions.

Compared to jail inmates of all races, when the statuses of
conviction are combined, American Indians were less likely to
have been jailed for a violent or drug offense (table 34).
However, consistent with their higher arrest rates for driving
under the influence of alcohol, a substantial percentage of
American Indians reported that they were in jail charged with or
convicted of an offense involving driving while intoxicated
(DWI).  American Indians accounted for an estimated 10% of
unconvicted jail inmates charged with DWI and just over 4% of
convicted DWI offenders in local jails.

About half of convicted American Indian inmates in local jails
had been consuming alcoholic beverages at the time of the
offense for which they had been convicted. An estimated

violent crime had been drinking when they committed the 
offense.

American Indians in 
the Federal justice system


In 1997 U.S. attorneys filed cases in Federal
district court against 1,126 American Indians.
Almost half of these cases involved a violent crime.

The majority of cases were filed in U.S. district
courts in South Dakota, Arizona, New Mexico, and
Montana.


American Indian
youth detained


In September 1994, American Indians were 
75 of the 124 juvenile delinquents confined
under Federal jurisdiction -- about 60% of
such juveniles.

The BJS Special Report Juvenile "Delinquents
in the Federal Criminal Justice System," 
February 1997, NCJ 163066, describes the 
circumstances of youth in the Federal system.

American Indians and the death penalty


Over the period 1973-97, 6,139 persons were sentenced to death
in the United States.  During the same years 52 American Indians
were sentenced to death, 0.8% of the total.  Between 1976 and
1997 a total of 432 persons were executed, including 3 American
Indians (0.7% of those executed).  This translates into a rate
of execution for those sentenced to death of about 7 per 100
persons receiving a death sentence and for American Indians,
about 5.8 per 100.

---------------------------------------------

Among the 6,139 persons sentenced to death, 3,335 were still
under a death sentence at the end of 1997 -- 54.3% of those
entering death row over the period.  For American Indians, 28 of
the 52 (53.8%) sentenced to death between 1973 and 1997 still
remained under a death sentence at the close of 1997. 

About half of all death sentences imposed upon American Indians
were in North Carolina (11) and Oklahoma (14).  Oklahoma (8) had
the largest number of American Indians currently under a
sentence to death.  No Federal death sentences were imposed on
American Indians during the period 1973-97.

American Indian tribal criminal justice


The BJS Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, 1996
identified 135 tribal law enforcement agencies with a total of
1,731 full-time sworn officers. The Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA), which also has law enforcement responsibility for
selected tribal jurisdictions, reported 339 full-time officers
authorized to make arrests and carry firearms.

In addition to law enforcement services, American Indian tribes
and the BIA operate jails in tribal areas.* (*BJS has conducted
a survey of tribal confinement facilities. Analysis of survey
responses will be reported in Survey of Jails in Indian Country,
1998, forthcoming, NCJ 173410.) Data provided by BIA indicate
that these facilities employed 659 persons and had an authorized
capacity to house just over 2,000 adults and juveniles (table
37).

Sources of data on American 
Indians and crime



One of the challenges facing all Federal statistical agencies is
that representative statistical data about American Indians are
difficult to acquire and use.  This is true for a number of
reasons with respect to crime data:

Sampling -- Most Federal surveys utilize nationally
representative samples of persons or households, thus limiting
the capability to describe small population subgroups in detail.
(American Indians comprise under 1% of the U.S. population.) In
addition, sampling procedures, relying upon selection of
respondents within clustered geographical sampling units, may by
chance miss those areas where concentrations of residences of
small subgroups (such as American Indians) may be located.
Finally, the fluidity of population movement between tribal and
nontribal areas for both Indian and non-Indian populations makes
it difficult to systematically describe those living in these
areas.  The 1990 Census revealed, for example, that nearly half
the population of reservation and trust lands was non-Indian.

The design of national surveys such as the NCVS does not permit
calculating separate statistics for each American Indian tribe.

Coverage of data -- Statistical coverage of incidents or cases
in Indian country utilizing law enforcement, judicial, or
corrections data is difficult to quantify because Federal,
State, and local authorities may have overlapping jurisdiction
on tribal lands.  Data about some crimes are collected by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Indian country while other
crimes by or against American Indians are recorded by local
sheriffs or police.  Arrest data are profoundly limited by the
lack of information on arrest coverage among tribal and BIA law
enforcement agencies.  

Data on trends -- Crime data relying upon either samples of
population or incident and case-level data from administrative
records suffers from the lack of repetitive collection so that
change rates and trends can be analyzed.  Much data on the
employment, education, and quality of life measures of American
Indians are only available from periodic collections and are
often of only limited value for comparisons over time. Often
many years have passed since they were last conducted. Agencies
do not generally use some form of aggregation or multi-year
averages for examining change or for comparisons to other racial
or ethnic groups.

These limitations severely circumscribe the depth and
generalizability of data on American Indians and inhibit the
Nation's ability to know much of the details about victims,
offenders, and the consequences of crime for both.  BJS has made
a strong commitment toward improving this situation through the
National Crime Victimization Survey, improvements planned for
the National Incident-Based Reporting System, and periodic BJS
surveys of offender populations. 



National Crime Victimization Survey



The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is one of two
statistical series maintained by the Department of Justice to
learn about the extent to which crime is occurring.  The NCVS,
which gathers data on criminal victimization from a national
sample of household respondents, provides annual estimates of
crimes experienced by the public without regard to whether a law
enforcement agency was called about the crime.  Initiated in
1972, the NCVS was designed to complement what is known about
crimes reported to local law enforcement agencies under the
FBI's annual compilation known as the Uniform Crime Reports
(UCR).

The NCVS gathers information about crime and its consequences
from a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents age 12
or older about any crimes they may have experienced. For
personal contact crimes the survey asks about the perpetrator.
Asking the victim about his/her relationship to the offender is
critical to determining whether the crime occurred between
intimates.

In the latter half of the 1980's, BJS, with the Committee on Law
and Justice of the American Statistical Association, sought to
improve the NCVS components to enhance the measurement of crimes
including rape, sexual assault, and intimate and family
violence.  The new questions and revised procedures were phased
in from January 1992 through June 1993 in half the sampled
households.  Since July 1993 the redesigned methods have been
used for the entire national sample.  

One of the important contributions of the NCVS is that it
permits multiple years of responses to the same questions to be
analyzed, facilitating research on small subgroups of the
population.  For this study 5 years of NCVS data (1992-96) were
combined, resulting in more than 1.1 million interviews, just
over 7,000 of which were conducted among American Indians.  This
represents the largest national sample of American Indians
assembled for purposes of better understanding the incidence and
effects of criminal victimization.  In addition, changes are
being introduced to the NCVS which will permit future
disaggregation of those incidents occurring on tribal lands from
those occurring elsewhere.  
 


Uniform Crime Reporting program



The UCR program of the FBI provides another opportunity to
examine the issue of crime and violence among American Indians
through the incident-based Supplementary Homicide Report program
and the summary compilation of national arrest data.  The
summary-based arrest component of the UCR provides data by race
of arrestees for both Part I crimes and the less serious Part II
crimes.  

In 1996 detailed data by race and offense were available for
about 3 out of 4 arrests nationwide (about 11.1 million of the 
estimated 15.2 million arrests that year).  American Indians are 
estimated to account for just under 1% of those arrested for 
Part I violent crimes and a slightly higher percentage of those
arrested for Part I property crimes.  Part II arrest offenses
show that American Indians comprise larger percentages of those
arrested for DUI, vagrancy, liquor law violations, and public
drunkenness.

Specific UCR coverage of those arrests by tribal or BIA law
enforcement agencies is not known, and the extent to which they
are included in the national estimates of arrests is not
systematically described.  In addition, the 1996 UCR does
indicate reduced reporting of arrests by race (table 43) and
that a number of jurisdictions (Kentucky, Illinois, the District
of Columbia, Florida, Vermont, Kansas, and Montana) supplied
either limited or no arrest data.  Some of these incomplete or
missing States, notably Montana, may affect the national
estimates for American Indians.  



National Incident-Based Reporting System



The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) represents
the next generation of crime data from law enforcement agencies.
Rather than being restricted to a group of 8 Index crimes that
the summary-based program uses, NIBRS obtains information on 57
types of crimes.  The information collected on each violent
crime incident includes victim-offender demographics,
victim-offender relationship, time and place of occurrence,
weapon use, and victim injuries.  An important contribution of
NIBRS is that investigating officers are asked to record
information on the race of victims and offenders in the
incident.  

As of the end of 1997, jurisdictions certified by the FBI as
capable of reporting incident-based data in the required format
accounted for just over 7% of the U.S. population (about 19
million Americans) and just over 6% of all Index crimes
(murders, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries,
larcenies, and motor vehicle thefts).  In those States with
certified NIBRS systems, about 50% of the population is now
covered by NIBRS reporting to the FBI.  

BJS is currently funding preliminary studies of NIBRS data on
two Indian reservations and their utility for improving our
knowledge of crime with special regard for such concerns as
intimate violence, family violence, and domestic violence and
the role alcohol may play in these kinds of police-reported
incidents.  The Mille Lac (Minnesota) and Lummi (Washington)
tribal law enforcement agencies will use NIBRS data as a part of
a case-tracking system to follow the subsequent processing of
criminal incidents brought to the attention of police.



Surveys of probationers and jail 
and prison inmates



BJS also conducts national surveys of persons under probation
supervision and those confined in local jails and State and
Federal prisons.  These nationally representative surveys are
the principal source of information on those serving time
following a conviction:  their backgrounds, their prior criminal
histories, and the circumstances surrounding the offense for
which they had been incarcerated.  Both jail and prison surveys
obtain from violent offenders details about the offender's
relationship to the victim and how the crime was carried out.
All surveys ask respondents to identify their race and ethnicity.



Law Enforcement Management 
and Administrative Statistics



BJS maintains the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) series as the principal national source of
data on the operations of police and sheriff's departments
nationwide.  LEMAS compiles information every 3 to 4 years from
all large law enforcement agencies (at least 100 sworn
personnel) and a sample of all other departments.  To create the
sample BJS also sponsors the Census of State and Local Law
Enforcement Agencies, collecting basic information about the
functions and number of personnel of all agencies in the United
States.  

LEMAS data are obtained on the organization and administration
of law enforcement agencies, agency responsibilities, operating
expenditures, job functions, weapons policies, and demographic
characteristics of sworn personnel.  BJS obtains similar
information from campus law enforcement agencies and Federal law
enforcement agencies.

LEMAS data are available on the race and ethnicity of law
enforcement personnel since 1987.



National Judicial Reporting Program



The National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP) is a biennial
sample survey of court records on convicted felons nationwide. 
Using a nationally representative sample of counties, NJRP 
compiles information on the sentences that felons receive 
in State courts and on the characteristics of convicted felons. 
The NJRP first reported felony sentencing data for 1986 and 
has provided national estimates at 2-year intervals since that 
time.

In addition to the convicted felon's race and ethnicity, NJRP
obtains individual-level data on the conviction offense,

Federal Justice Statistics Program

 
The Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP) provides annual
data on workload, activities, and case outcomes in the Federal
criminal justice system.  Information is reported on all aspects
of case processing in the Federal justice system including the
number of persons investigated, prosecuted, convicted,
incarcerated, sentenced to probation, released prior to trial,
handled by magistrates, sentencing outcomes, and time served.
Data for this series are obtained from the Executive Office for
U.S. Attorneys, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,
the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and the Federal Bureau of
Prisons.

Data are available by defendant race and ethnicity at each
processing stage of the Federal criminal justice system.  The
FJSP was initiated in 1980.

American Indian Movement
------------------------

The American Indian Movement (AIM) is a Native American grassroots
movement that was founded in July 1968 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
A.I.M. was initially formed in urban areas to address systemic issues
of poverty and police brutality against Native Americans.  A.I.M. soon
widened its focus from urban issues to include many Indigenous Tribal
issues that Native American groups have faced due to settler
colonialism of the Americas, such as treaty rights, high rates of
unemployment, education, cultural continuity, and preservation of
Indigenous cultures.

In the decades since AIM's founding, the group has led protests
advocating indigenous American interests, inspired cultural renewal,
monitored police activities and coordinated employment programs in
cities and in rural reservation communities across the United States
and indigenous interests outside the United States as well.

In 1993, AIM split into two factions, each claiming to be the
authentic inheritor of the AIM tradition. The AIM-Grand Governing
Council is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and associated with
leadership by Clyde Bellecourt and his brother Vernon Bellecourt (who
died in 2007). The GGC tends toward a more centralized, controlled
political philosophy.

The AIM-International Confederation of Autonomous Chapters, based in
Denver, Colorado, was founded by thirteen AIM chapters in 1993 at a
meeting in Denver, Colorado. The group issued its Edgewood
Declaration, citing organizational grievances and complaining of
authoritarian leadership by the Bellecourts. Ideological differences
were growing, with the AIM-International Confederation of Autonomous
Chapters taking a spiritual, perhaps more mainstream, approach to
activism. The autonomous chapters group argues that AIM has always
been organized as a series of decentralized, autonomous chapters, with
local leadership accountable to local constituencies. The autonomous
chapters reject the assertions of central control by the Minneapolis
group as contrary both to indigenous political traditions and to the
original philosophy of AIM.

Jordan Dill's AIM Site
----------------------

NOTE: As of December, 1996 the Editor of Indian Country Today has
stated the following:

> "At Indian Country Today we use internet sources as potential leads
> for stories. We carefully check the sources and authenticate
> information. We do not consider much of the internet as a factual
> source. Indian Country Today will no longer visit the [First
> Nations] web site ... because of [its] continued proliferation of
> gossip, rumor and innuendo in their misguided attempt to support
> American Indian issues. ...misleading and misinformed sources may
> harm innocent people and cause others unnecessary anguish. "

In light of the Editor's antipathy towards Leonard Peltier, AIM, Peter
Matthiessen and his support for the FBI, I consider his declaration an
endorsement of this site's veracity.

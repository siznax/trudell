Bay Area American Indian Two-Spirits (BAAITS) exists to restore and
recover the role of Two-Spirit people within the American Indian/First
Nations community by creating a forum for the spiritual, cultural and
artistic expression of Two-Spirit people.

### Bay Area American Indian Two-Spirit Powwow

https://www.baaits.org/powwow

All are welcome to join the Native American two-spirits community for
the ninth annual “Bay Area American Indian Two-Spirit (BAAITS) Powwow”
at Fort Mason Center for Arts & Culture. The “Two-Spirit Powwow”
celebrates traditional Native American culture and also provides a
gender-affirming experience for the diverse two-spirits community, the
LGBT community, and allies. The 2020 event honors missing and murdered
indigenous women.

The free “Two-Spirit Powwow” is open to all (Native American and
non-Native) and features performers from every tribal nation in
traditional Native American regalia (clothing), dancing, singing,
drumming, contests, and joyful celebration. On-site vendors sell
frybread, buffalo burgers, Native art and jewelry, and other items.

Forced Migration of Native Americans
====================================

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer#Native_American_relocations

In the 19th century, the United States government removed a number of
Native Americans to federally-owned and -designated Indian
reservations. Native Americans were removed from the Northern to the
Western States. The most well-known removals were those of the 1830s
from the Southeast, starting with the Choctaw people. Under the 1830
Indian Removal Act, the Five Civilized Tribes were relocated from
their place, east of the Mississippi River, to the Indian Territory in
the west. The process resulted in great social dislocation for all,
numerous deaths, and the "Trail of Tears" for the Cherokee
Nation. Resistance to Indian removal led to several violent conflicts,
including the Second Seminole War in Florida.

The Long Walk of the Navajo refers to the 1864 relocation of the
Navajo people by the US government in a forced walk from their land in
what is now Arizona to eastern New Mexico. The Yavapai people were
forcibly marched from Camp Verde Reservation to San Carlos Apache
Indian Reservation, Arizona, on February 27, 1875, following the
Yavapai War. The federal government restricted Plains Indians to
reservations following several Indian Wars in which Indians and
European Americans fought over lands and resources. Indian prisoners
of war were held at Fort Marion and Fort Pickens in Florida.

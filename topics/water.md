The Ogallala Aquifer
--------------------

The Ogallala Aquifer (oh-guh-LAH-luh) is a shallow water table aquifer
surrounded by sand, silt, clay, and gravel located beneath the Great
Plains in the United States. One of the world's largest aquifers, it
underlies an area of approximately 174,000 sq mi (450,000 km2) in
portions of eight states (South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado,
Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas).[1] It was named in 1898 by
geologist N. H. Darton from its type locality near the town of
Ogallala, Nebraska. The aquifer is part of the High Plains Aquifer
System, and rests on the Ogallala Formation, which is the principal
geologic unit underlying 80% of the High Plains.[2][3]

Large scale extraction for agricultural purposes started after World
War II due partially to center pivot irrigation and to the adaptation
of automotive engines for groundwater wells.[4] Today about 27% of the
irrigated land in the entire United States lies over the aquifer,
which yields about 30% of the ground water used for irrigation in the
United States.[5] The aquifer is at risk for over-extraction and
pollution. Since 1950, agricultural irrigation has reduced the
saturated volume of the aquifer by an estimated 9%. Once depleted, the
aquifer will take over 6,000 years to replenish naturally through
rainfall.[6]

The aquifer system supplies drinking water to 82% of the 2.3 million
people (1990 census) who live within the boundaries of the High Plains
study area.[7]

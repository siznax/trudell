American Bison Society
----------------------

The American Bison Society (ABS) was founded in 1905 by pioneering
conservationists and sportsmen including William T. Hornaday and
Theodore Roosevelt to help save the bison from extinction and raise
public awareness about the species.

Over 40 million American bison (Bison bison) once roamed the plains
and grasslands from Mexico to central Canada, shaping the landscape
with their migrations, grazing patterns, and behavior. By the 1870s,
their populations had been decimated by westward expansion and
over-hunting. An 1889 survey published by Hornaday, who would go on to
become the first director of the Bronx Zoo, showed that approximately
1,000 bison remained in North America.

Buffalo Commons
---------------

The Buffalo Commons is a conceptual proposal to create a vast nature
preserve by returning 139,000 square miles (360,000 km2) of the drier
portion of the Great Plains to native prairie, and by reintroducing
the American bison ("buffalo"), that once grazed the shortgrass
prairie. The proposal would affect ten states: Montana, Wyoming,
Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Nebraska, and Kansas.

The Great Bison Belt
--------------------

The great bison belt is a tract of rich grassland that ran from Alaska
to the Gulf of Mexico around 9000 BC. The great bison belt was
supported by spring and early summer rainfall that allowed short
grasses to grow. These grasses retain their moisture at the roots
which allowed for grazing ungulates such as bison to find high-quality
nutritious food in autumn.

These grasses are what allowed the bison population to thrive, as they
were able to receive all of their nutrients from the short grasses,
unlike other Ice Age animals which expanded in the postglacial
period. This area was important to the Plains Paleo-Indians, who
around 8500 BC turned to bison hunting instead of hunting a broader
range of food.

Wind Cave bison herd
--------------------

The Wind Cave bison herd is a herd of 250â€“400 American bison in Wind
Cave National Park, South Dakota, USA. It is believed to be one of
only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in
North America. The other three herds are the Yellowstone Park bison
herd, the Henry Mountains bison herd in Central Utah, and at Elk
Island National Park in Alberta, Canada. The Wind Cave herd are of the
Plains bison subspecies (Bison bison bison).

Yellowstone Park bison herd
---------------------------

The Yellowstone Park bison herd in Yellowstone National Park is
probably the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United
States. Yellowstone is known for its geothermal activity and large
mammals, especially elk, timber wolves, bison, bears, pronghorns,
moose and bighorn sheep. The Yellowstone Park bison herd was estimated
in 2015 to be 4,900 bison. The bison in the Yellowstone Park bison
herd are American bison of the Plains bison subspecies. Yellowstone
National Park may be the only location in the United States where
free-ranging bison were never extirpated, since they continued to
exist in the wild and were not re-introduced, as has been done in most
other bison herd areas. Other large free-ranging, publicly controlled
herds of bison in the United States include the Tallgrass Prairie
Preserve in Oklahoma (2,100 to 2,600 animals), Wind Cave bison herd
(approximately 350 animals), the Antelope Island bison herd
(approximately 550 to 700 animals), the Henry Mountains bison herd in
Utah (400 to 500 animals), and the National Bison Range herd near
Flathead Lake, Montana (400 animals).

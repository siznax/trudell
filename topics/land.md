Indian Country
--------------

Indian country is any of the many self-governing Native American
communities throughout the United States. As a legal category, it
includes "all land within the limits of any Indian reservation", "all
dependent Indian communities within the borders of the United States",
and "all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been
extinguished." This legal classification defines American Indian
tribal and individual land holdings as part of a reservation, an
allotment, or a public domain allotment. All federal trust lands held
for Native American tribes is Indian country. Federal, state, and
local governments use this category in their legal processes. Today,
however, according to the U.S. Census of 2010, over 78% of all Native
Americans live off reservations. Indian country now spans thousands of
rural areas, towns and cities where Indian people live.

This convention is followed generally in colloquial speech and is
reflected in publications such as the Native American newspaper Indian
Country Today.

Indian Reservation
------------------

An Indian reservation is a legal designation for an area of land
managed by a federally recognized Indian tribe under the U.S. Bureau
of Indian Affairs rather than the state governments of the United
States in which they are physically located. Each of the 326 Indian
reservations in the United States is associated with a particular
Native American nation. Not all of the country's 567 recognized
tribes have a reservation—some tribes have more than one reservation,
while some share reservations. In addition, because of past land
allotments, leading to some sales to non–Native Americans, some
reservations are severely fragmented, with each piece of tribal,
individual, and privately held land being a separate enclave. This
jumble of private and public real estate creates significant
administrative, political, and legal difficulties.

Indian Territory
----------------

The Indian Territory and the Indian Territories are terms that
generally describe an evolving land area set aside by the United
States Government for the relocation of Native Americans who held
aboriginal title to their land as a sovereign independent state. In
general, the tribes ceded land they occupied in exchange for land
grants in 1803. The concept of an Indian Territory was an outcome of
the US federal government's 18th- and 19th-century policy of Indian
removal. After the American Civil War (1861–1865), the policy of the
US government was one of assimilation.

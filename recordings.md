> We're faced with a very serious situation in this generation. There
> are insane people who wish to rule the world. They wish to continue
> to rule the world on violence and repression and we are all the
> victims of that violence and repression. We as the indigenous people
> of the Western Hemisphere have been resisting this violence in this
> oppression for 500 years. We know that the black people have been
> resisting it for at least that long, and we know that the white
> people have had to endure it thousands of years and now it's come
> full swing to this generation that we live in.

> From November 20, 1969, to June 11, 1971, a group called Indians of
> All Tribes occupied Alcatraz Island off the coast of San Francisco,
> California. The Alcatraz takeover was done to protest federal laws
> that contradicted historic land treaties with the Indians and aimed to
> destroy American Indian cultures, including the right of tribes to
> self-govern. This occupation was the first of its kind and inspired
> Native Americans to fight for their civil rights, as well as expose
> their issues to the North American public. The Alcatraz occupation was
> forcibly ended by the U.S. government, but was successful in many
> ways. It publicized the American Indian civil rights movement and
> fueled the American Indian Movement (AIM) to occupy 74 more federal
> facilities, culminating in the occupation of Wounded Knee on the Pine
> Ridge Reservation of the Oglala Sioux in South Dakota in 1973. Not
> least of all, this inspirational and highly public political
> demonstration initiated major changes in U.S. government laws
> regarding American Indian land claims and their right to tribal
> self-rule.
> 
> Radio Free Alcatraz was conceived to give a voice to the voiceless
> minority of Native Americans. On December 22, 1969, KPFA began its
> first live broadcast from Alcatraz, under the direction of John
> Trudell, a Santee Sioux from Nebraska who was relocated to the Bay
> Area with his wife and two children. With borrowed and donated radio
> equipment, the programs originated from the main cell block building
> on Alcatraz, and were carried live by the Pacifica Network, which
> consisted, at the time, of KPFA, Berkeley; KPFK, Los Angeles; and
> WBAI, New York weekday evenings at 7:15 p.m. PST. Each episode began
> with a recording of Buffy Sainte-Marie singing "Now that the Buffalo's
> Gone." The series of news reports on the Indians of All Tribes
> occupation of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco was recorded and
> broadcast live from 22 Dec. 1969-3 Sept. 1970. The Pacifica Radio
> Archives currently holds 39 episodes from between December 29, 1969
> and August 13, 1970.
> 
> Besides the reels in this series, episodes of Radio free Alcatraz can
> be found in BB5414 and BB5415. BB5457.39-.40 are currently unavailable.

A widower living in the desert waits for the end of the world. When a

A young widower (River Phoenix) retreats to a remote nuclear testing
site to await the apocalypse, but finds his solitude disrupted by a
high-powered Hollywood couple (Jonathan Pryce and Judy Davis) whose
car broke down during a drive through the desert. Initially coming to
the couple's aid, the isolated man soon decides to imprison
them. Though director George Sluizer (The Vanishing) originally ceased

1992 · Mystery/Western · 1h 59m

When a series of murders stuns a small Native American reservation,
the FBI sends in agent Ray Levoi (Val Kilmer) to investigate. While
Ray is relatively inexperienced, he is one quarter Sioux, and the FBI
hopes that will make it easier for them to gather information from the
locals. While the reservation police officer (Graham Greene) views the
agent as an outsider, the tribal elder (Chief Ted Thin Elk) believes
him to be the reincarnated spirit of Thunderheart, a Native American
hero.


### Incident at Oglala: The Leonard Peltier Story

![alt](https://zinnedproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IncidentOglala-261x400.jpg)

1992 ‧ Documentary/Political Drama ‧ 1h 30m · PG

Robert Redford narrates this documentary about the Pine Ridge Shootout
on an Oglala Sioux reservation in South Dakota. On June 26, 1975, two
FBI agents are searching for tribesman Leonard Peltier, wanted in
connection with an assault. They are killed after coming under heavy
fire, presumably from Peltier and his accomplices. However, proponents
claim that the FBI botched the investigation by tampering with and
suppressing evidence, and that Peltier's imprisonment is a miscarriage
of justice.

Michael Apted's documentary examines the 1975 slaying of two FBI
agents in Oglala, SD, which resulted in the arrest and conviction of
Native American activist Leonard Peltier for the murders. Making a
case for a retrial, Apted chronicles the tensions extant between the
U.S. government and the Oglala people since their occupation of
Wounded Knee in 1973 and examines the questionable circumstances
surrounding the investigation and subsequent trial of Peltier. The
film is a companion to Apted's own Thunderheart, which offers a
fictionalized account of the same case.

### John Trudell's Hollywood Career (1989-2012)

Trudell created a career as an actor, performing in roles in "Pow
Wow Highway" (1989), Thunderheart (1992), On Deadly Ground (1994)
and Smoke Signals (1998) (as the Radio speaker Randy Peone on K-REZ
radio[23]). He was an adviser to the production of Incident at
Oglala, directed by Michael Apted and produced by Robert Redford. A
kind of companion piece to the fictional Thunderheart, the 1992
documentary explores facts related to the 1975 shooting of two FBI
agents at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, for which Leonard
Peltier was convicted in 1977. In Thunderheart, Trudell played a
character who resembles Peltier.

Dreamkeeper (2003) "The Legends of American Nations Come to Life"
features several traditional native stories. Trudell played a
character named Coyote in a story about A Spider and Coyote.

The 1838 Cherokee removal from the southeastern United States is
chronicled.

Narrated by James Earl Jones, "Trail of Tears: Cherokee Legacy"
explores one of the great historical tragedies of America's aboriginal
people. In 1830, eager to gain access to lands inhabited by Native
Americans, President Andrew Jackson enacted the Indian Removal Act

into unchartered territory. Many of these forced settlers suffered
from exposure, disease and starvation during the relocation. Nearly
one quarter of the Cherokee Nation died along the way.

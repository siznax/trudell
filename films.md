1985 ‧ Documentary/Historical Documentary ‧ 1h 10m · R

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan's controversial Secretary of the
Interior James Watt sold coal leases on federal land in New Mexico and
Arizona to developers for exploration and mining. Thousands of members
of the Navajo tribe lived on this land, part of their ancestral
homeland, and were forcibly relocated away from their homes. This
documentary examines this and other injustices in the U.S./Navajo
relationship. Narrated by actor Martin Sheen, the film won a Best
Documentary Feature Oscar.


### Incident at Oglala: The Leonard Peltier Story

![]()

1992 ‧ Documentary/Political Drama ‧ 1h 30m · PG

Robert Redford narrates this documentary about the Pine Ridge Shootout
on an Oglala Sioux reservation in South Dakota. On June 26, 1975, two
FBI agents are searching for tribesman Leonard Peltier, wanted in
connection with an assault. They are killed after coming under heavy
fire, presumably from Peltier and his accomplices. However, proponents
claim that the FBI botched the investigation by tampering with and
suppressing evidence, and that Peltier's imprisonment is a miscarriage
of justice.

Michael Apted's documentary examines the 1975 slaying of two FBI
agents in Oglala, SD, which resulted in the arrest and conviction of
Native American activist Leonard Peltier for the murders. Making a
case for a retrial, Apted chronicles the tensions extant between the
U.S. government and the Oglala people since their occupation of
Wounded Knee in 1973 and examines the questionable circumstances
surrounding the investigation and subsequent trial of Peltier. The
film is a companion to Apted's own Thunderheart, which offers a
fictionalized account of the same case.


### The Trail of Tears: Cherokee Legacy

![]()

2006 ‧ Documentary ‧ 1h 55m

The 1838 Cherokee removal from the southeastern United States is chronicled.

Narrated by James Earl Jones, "Trail of Tears: Cherokee Legacy"
explores one of the great historical tragedies of America's aboriginal
people. In 1830, eager to gain access to lands inhabited by Native
Americans, President Andrew Jackson enacted the Indian Removal Act
which forced the Cherokee Nation to leave their homeland and relocate
into unchartered territory. Many of these forced settlers suffered
from exposure, disease and starvation during the relocation. Nearly
one quarter of the Cherokee Nation died along the way.

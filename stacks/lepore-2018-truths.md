These Truths (2018) Jill Lepore
===============================

I’ve been a big fan of Jill Lepore and I have not yet read _These
Truths_ (only skimmed it), but her omission of Native Americans, if
true, would be simply unforgiveable. I sincerely hope she does not
produce a textbook with the same problem.

The Vanishing Indians of “These Truths”

> The book proposes to tell a wide-ranging story, and in many
> respects, like its consideration of the protracted struggle for
> racial equality, it poses a timely rejoinder to airport best-sellers
> trafficking in whitewashed tales of Founding Fathers and military
> generals. But the narrative Lepore constructs relies on the eventual
> exit of indigenous actors to make way for other dramas.

> These Truths underestimates readers’ capacities to deal with
> historical complexity and the nuanced ways that indigenous
> experiences trouble convenient story lines about America’s most
> iconic moments.

> The equation of indigeneity with “early” is a pernicious trope in
> antiquarian history writing, as Jean O’Brien has demonstrated in
> Firsting and Lasting: Writing Indians Out of Existence in New
> England.

How do Native Americans observe the 4th of July? This year, many
people's plans reflect their concerns about the coronavirus
pandemic. But the answer has always been as complicated as America's
history.

Perhaps the most quoted language in the Declaration of Independence is
the statement that all men are created equal. Many Native Americans,
however, also remember the signers' final grievance against the king: 

> _He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has
> endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the
> merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an
> undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions._

With the emergence of a nation interested in expanding its territory
came the issue of what to do with American Indians, who were already
living all across the land. As the American non-Indian population
increased, the Indigenous population greatly decreased, along with
tribal homelands and cultural freedoms. From the beginning,
U.S. government policy contributed to the loss of culture and land.

Keeping our focus on the 4th of July, let's jump ahead to the 1880s,
when the U.S. government developed what has come to be called the
Religious Crimes Code--regulations at the heart of the federal Office
of Indian Affairs' Code of Indian Offenses that prohibited American
Indian ceremonial life. Enforced on reservations, the code banned
Indian dances and feasts, disrupted religious practices, and destroyed
or confiscated sacred objects, under threat of imprisonment and the
withholding of treaty rations. The Secretary of the Interior issued
the regulations in 1884, 1894, and 1904, and Indian superintendents
and agents implemented them until the mid-1930s. For 50 years, Indian
spiritual ceremonies were held in secret or ceased to exist.

In response to this policy of cultural and religious suppression, some
tribes saw in the 4th of July and the commemoration of American
independence a chance to continue their own important
ceremonies. Indian superintendents and agents justified allowing
reservations to conduct ceremonies on the 4th as a way for Indians to
learn patriotism to the United States and to celebrate the country's
ideals.

That history is why a disproportionate number of American Indian
tribal gatherings take place on or near the 4th of July and are often
the social highlights of the year. Over time these cultural ceremonies
became tribal homecomings. American Indian veterans in particular were
welcomed home as modern-day followers of warrior traditions. The
Navajo Tribe of Arizona and Pawnee of Oklahoma are two examples of
tribes that use the 4th of July to honor their tribal veterans. Tribal
veterans' songs and flag songs are sung. Before the Reservation Era,
when most Indians saw the American flag coming toward their villages
and camps, it symbolized conflict, death, and destruction. But more
than 12,000 American Indians served during World War I, and after the
war, the American flag began to be given a prominent position at
American Indian gatherings, especially those held on the 4th of
July. This symbol of patriotism and national unity is carried into
powwow and rodeo arenas today.

Everything is different this year, with families following public
health guidance to reduce the transmission of Covid-19. But
traditionally, the Lumbee of North Carolina and Mattaponi of Virginia
use the 4th of July as a time for tribal members to renew cultural and
family ties. The Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma holds Gourd Clan ceremonies,
because the holiday coincides with their Sun Dance, which once took
place during the hottest part of the year. The Lakota of South Dakota
and Cheyenne of Oklahoma have some of their annual Sun Dances on the
weekends closest to the 4th of July to coincide with the celebration
of their New Year.

Another summer soon, tribes will resume holding ceremonies, as well as
powwows, rodeos, homecomings, and other modern get-togethers, around
Independence Day. And Native American families will set out on visits
back to their reservations and home communities. 

This year, my father and I will go to our fishing spot at a lake near
our house. We'll talk to family in Oklahoma, where my older daughter
is about to begin studying toward her childhood dream of becoming a
nurse. I have so much pride and hope for both my daughters. And I'll
think about our grandmothers' and grandfathers' perseverance and sense
of community, which saw them through so much so that we could be here.

How will other Native Americans across the country spend the day this
year? As before, the museum asked Native friends on Facebook to share
their thoughts. Here are some of their answers:

**Webster, Massachusetts:** Independence Day carries many significant
meanings to my family, but nothing most would think. During the time
when Natives could be arrested or worse for practicing ceremonies and
dances, the 4th of July was an opportunity do those things. Many
Indigenous people were able to practice certain ceremonies under the
guise of celebrating Independence Day.

Like many Native people, especially on the East Coast, I have three
ancestors, and likely more, who fought in the Revolutionary
War. Without the support of Indigenous people, America would have
never come to be. . . . Independence Day is a bittersweet reminder of
our sacrifice and loss, but also the bravery and tenacity that gave
our ancestors the impetus to find a way to keep our culture alive.

**Fort Hall, Idaho:** We celebrate our Treaty Day on July 3. There
will be smudging and prayer for our people at our arbor, with social
distance at the arbor and online viewing for people at home.

**Fort Cobb, Oklahoma:** Normally, this would be a time of renewal and
rejuvenation for our Kiowa people, celebrating in unity. At heart,
this year is no exception: I'll be with my family, praying for
continued healing and a prosperous year for our Cauigu (Kiowa) and
Native peoples.

**Carnegie, Oklahoma:** We are usually in camp by now, but this year
we have canceled our celebration. We have many in mourning, and Covid
has everyone on lockdown, so I really don't have any plans. Just
staying home and safe! We'll be taking time to be thankful for our
blessings, and looking forward to the time that we can celebrate and
dance together again. In the meantime, we'll be beading and creating.

**Arlee, Montana:** Well, considering we won't be at a powwow this
year, me and my family will be floating the Blackfoot River that day
and then getting together for some dinner afterwards. We are all
purchasing fireworks this year--we all love fireworks--and just
chilling and visiting with one another and enjoying family.

You can enjoy family, or the day, without making it about their
independence. That's what we do with powwows, some of the
longest-running in Indian Country. Plus, it's one of those times that
family and friends have off together from work, and in our busy lives
we don't get a lot of opportunity to spend time with family and
friends. I am from Montana--we are in Phase 2 of reopening and will be
following all guidance that pertains to that. Be safe and enjoy the
day off.

**Alexandria, Virginia:** My Lumbee Tribe cancelled our annual Lumbee
Homecoming, which is always scheduled for the week of July 4. All my
Virginia relatives usually attend. This year? My Native family will be
gathering at my sister's home for a barbeque. There will be drumming,
and we'll try to get some dancing going on. I like to bring old
pictures of our Native ancestors to share with my nieces and
nephews. They enjoy hearing how their 85-year-old-Tuscarora
grandmother grew up attending a longhouse for ceremonies, and how her
family received federal recognition in 1936, were terminated in 1970,
and gained federal recognition again in 1973.

**Mesa, Arizona:** Stay home and be safe with my family. And make red
chile posole with fry bread--yummy.

**Tahlequah, Oklahoma:** I will be celebrating our new year during our
Greencorn Ceremony at Echota _gatiyo _[stomp or ceremonial
grounds]. It's a time of renewal and new beginnings. I personally do
not observe Independence Day.

**Dallas, Texas:** I will be spending the day at home to be safe. I
live in the Dallas rural area, and Covid-19 is still rising here. Now,
being First Nations people, I have never celebrated the 4th. It is a
reminder of what has happened to our people. White history portrays
this land as nothing till they discovered it. I could go on, but don't
want to start the day off being irritated. I'm Chiricahua Apache.

**White Swan, Washington:** Light our fireworks at home instead of in
streets and instead of going to other events, which have been
canceled.

**Apache Junction, Arizona:** We have 13 wildfires right now in
Arizona, some human-caused, the rest by lightning. It's not a good
idea for people to do fireworks here. We never do anyway.

**Tomah, Wisconsin:** I'm staying home. I've seen enough fireworks in
the past. A nice quiet time at home, enjoying the evening in Ho-Chunk
Cranberry Country in Wisconsin.

**Cumberland, Virginia:** I'm staying home. I don't care for
explosions, no matter how small. I always ask that people be mindful
of the veterans who are nearby when setting off fireworks.

**Duncannon, Pennsylvania:** We'll be at home. Our daughter . . . is
extremely high risk. Both my husband and I work in public
health. . . . The best thing we can all do right now is protect one
another through good hygiene, social distancing, and wearing a mask.

**Herod, Illinois:** Generally, we observe none of the Colonial
holidays, but I love fireworks. I won't be in any crowds. Relatives
may bring a bucket of fish to my door, I hope.

**Albuquerque, New Mexico:** Staying home. No firework displays
considering Covid-19 and the fire restrictions due to extreme dry
conditions.

**Harpers Ferry, West Virginia:** I will be staying home. Because of
cancer treatment, I am high risk, and most of the public fireworks
displays have been cancelled anyway, due to Covid. I am sure I will
still see and hear fireworks, because they have had a lot of stands
selling fireworks around here.

**Simpsonville, South Carolina:** Grilling in the backyard and
watching Will Smith _Independence Day_. (Greenville, South Carolina,
is a Covid hotspot!)

**Durango, Colorado:** Home away from large groups with me, myself,
and I plus two doggies, 45 minutes from the hotspot in Farmington, New
Mexico.

**Orlando, Florida:** I'm not celebrating, nor have I ever. This day
meant nothing to my ancestors and therefore means nothing to me.

**Oklahoma City, Oklahoma:** I like to start the 4th like I do every
year. I call friends and family, make sure everyone is doing
fine. . . . [Later] I will paint, because Santa Fe Indian Market is
still happening even though it's on line I still need to finish up a
painting and start another one. Once the sun goes down, I'll jump into
the car with my girlfriend and go watch fireworks somewhere. Did I
mention I love being in Oklahoma City? Fireworks will be everywhere!

These are answers we highlighted in earlier years:

**Kansas City, Missouri:** Some important tribes helped both the
colonies and the British fight the Revolutionary War, and others gave
aid. And some tribes continued fighting for the United States after
the country was established, right through the Civil War. So it does
not bother me to celebrate the 4th of July. . . . The government
formed by that 1776 revolution, even though it nearly exterminated us,
still rules this land today, and has changed enough now to give those
of us left a chance for survival. We are all changed, but Indians have
always supported the U.S. government in one way or another.

**Anadarko, Oklahoma:** On July 4, 1967, I was in Vietnam, a
short-timer waiting to come home. I didn't celebrate Independence Day,
because the meaning is different for most Native Americans. I just
wanted to be in Oklahoma. That time of the year is like a homecoming
for Kiowa people around Carnegie. Or like the Summer Solstice--the
beginning of a new year, a renewal of traditions, friendships, and a
happy time. No matter where I was stationed or lived, I tried to be in
Carnegie at the Annual Kiowa Gourd Clan Dance. One of those times I
was at a Sun Dance on the last day. It was Sunday, July 4. Everything
was over, and the last meal had been consumed. The sun had just set to
the west, and the whole camp was at rest, when a fireworks display
erupted to the east and we were treated to a spectacular show of
beauty and color to end a great year. My roots are deeply embedded in
home, family, and traditions.

**Hogansburg, New York:** It doesn't make sense to celebrate one group
of foreigners' independence from another at the expense of our own
people and land. When we Mohawks and others fought in the U.S. War of
Independence, it was for our own survival, and even that was
controversial at the time.

**Fort Hall, Idaho:** I force my way into the office--break in to work
and not celebrate! I'm kidding. Since it's a federal holiday and we
have it off, we use the day off to practice our off-reservation
hunting and fishing rights and go salmon spearing. Or we go to a
powwow.  
  
**Mt. Rainier, Maryland:** As a veteran, I take the family to
celebrate the freedom we have, but also teach what the costs were
and still are to Native people.

**Bartlesville, Oklahoma:** We don't celebrate the 4th. Native
people did not become free from anything on that day. We do,
however, attend my wife's tribes' dance. We look forward to the
Quapaw Powwow each year as a family time, an opportunity to sing and
dance and practice our social traditions.

**Wilmington, Delaware:** My family acknowledges the sacrifices the
military has made for this country, even though the country has been
built on unsavory deeds. We are going to the Veterans Hospital to
talk about local Native culture with the vets who live there. I'll
also include some information about Native people in the military.

**Chicago, Illinois:** No, I never celebrated. I just liked watching
the fireworks when my crew were kids. It used to be while I was
working at the American Indian Center, we were always asked to walk
in parades and do dance performances.

**Caribou, Maine:** Cookouts and family mostly. . . . As far as
independence, fireworks are legal here, but you're not allowed to
set them off after 10 p.m. on July 4th.

**South Padre Island, Texas:** I do, but in another way. I celebrate
by honoring the war chiefs in my tribes for getting us through such
troubled times. . . . Independence still lives with us and in us.

**Sitka, Alaska:** As far as the 4th of July, my Tlingit dance group
has a fry bread booth. We sell it as a fundraiser to make it to the
biennial event known as Celebration, which is held in
Juneau. Usually around 40 dance groups attend, predominantly
Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian, which are the three tribes most
prevalent in Southeast Alaska. There are also sometimes guest dance
groups from other parts of Alaska or even the world. Our town
celebrates with booths, sometimes an organized collection of them
and sometimes a hodgepodge around town; fireworks on the night of
the 3rd, which the fuel company sponsors; and a parade on the 4th.

**Pueblo, Colorado:** My village celebrates July 7th. That's our
traditional chief's wedding anniversary.

**Lawrence, Kansas:** I personally do not celebrate the history of
the 4th of July. My celebration is to honor all the Native men and
women who have served and are serving this nation. . . . They were
and still are defending the only homelands our people have ever
known. We cannot run back to any other country or lands, because
this _is_ our country and our lands. _Mvto_ for allowing me to share
a little of my thought on the 4th of July! _Pah-bee_ [brother],
until the words of the Declaration of Independence are changed, I'm
still a merciless Indian Savage. And I can live with that, because
that's what my people before were called!

**Lancaster, Pennsylvania:** Having family in the military and now
our son, it has always been about the sacrifices made. We clean the
graves, plant or put up new flowers, and pray.

**Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin:** The Ho-Chunk Nation recognizes July
4th as Cpl. Mitchell RedCloud
Jr. Day. [Cpl. RedCloud](https://www.army.mil/article/138736/cpl_mitchell_red_cloud_jr)
was killed in action while serving in the Army during the Korean
War. He posthumously received the Medal of Honor for "dauntless
courage and gallant self-sacrifice" in battle near Chonghyon, North
Korea, on 5 November 1950.

**Omak, Washington:** The Nespelem celebration was originally a
defiant ruse by Chief Joseph. He had returned from Oklahoma, where
he saw the first powwows. The Army banned any tribal meetings and
gatherings at Colville. So the people came up with the idea of
fooling the United States into thinking we were celebrating
America's holiday. It worked. Indians came. It's been held ever
since. Now it's the week after the 4th of July, so we don't have to
compete with all the casino-sponsored powwows.

**Winterhaven, California:** I don't celebrate the 4th of July. It's
another day. I will be working. All tribal employees work that day.

beaded the name of the Sicangu Lakota leader Two Strike or Nomkahpa
(1831-1915)._

**Norman, Oklahoma:** Independence Day has a different meaning for
us as Native people. We exercise our freedom carrying on the
traditions of our people in whatever that form that may be. For me,
it is in Carnegie, Oklahoma, in Kiowa country, at the Kiowa Tia-Piah
(Gourd Clan) Society Celebration.

**Tulsa, Oklahoma:** I am headed to Quapaw Powwow, arguably the
longest running annual powwow--145 years. Our family and tribal
nation have always played host to friends and visitors from all over
the world.

**Laguna, New Mexico:** As much turmoil the United States government
has given our people in the past and present, my father has
instilled in my family a sense of loyalty, liberty, and
responsibility for our country. He is a Vietnam Veteran and could
easily have forsaken this country due to the treatment he and other
Vietnam veterans received upon their return. Instead, he chose to
defend the country and the land of Indigenous Americans. He then
raised his children and grandchildren to respect the country. So we
will spend the day probably watching a parade in the morning and
then have a BBQ with friends and family. We will honor and remember
the veterans on this day.

**Akwesasne Mohawk territory, Haudenosaunee territory:** We don't
celebrate the independence of our colonizer, especially considering
that George Washington ordered the Sullivan-Clinton Campaign of
burnings, displacement, and murder against the Haudenosaunee
villages during their war for Independence. This while so many of
our people were helping the Americans at Valley Forge, while
decisive battles were won due to Iroquois allies.

**Milwaukee, Wisconsin:** We have a powwow in Oneida every 4th of
July, because we fought with George Washington and the colonists to
help them win their independence.

**Saskatoon, Saskatchewan:** In Canada First Nations people are
faced with that dilemma this year more so than ever, because the
federal government is promoting their 150th anniversary and
reconciliation at the same time.

**Tomah, Wisconsin:** The 4th of July--my Ho-Chunk Nation made the
day known as Cpl. Mitchell Redcloud Jr. Day, with a powwow at the
Andrew Blackhawk Memorial Pow-Wow Grounds. My choka (grandfather)
was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, killed in
action during the Korean War. Mitchell Jr., was my maternal choka's
first cousin and was also a choka to me, Ho-Chunk relationship. I
will volunteer on the 4th, if my relatives, the Redcloud family,
need my assistance.

**Arizona and the Dine (Navajo) Nation:** Greet and end the day by
thanking Creator for another blessed day. We don't celebrate but use
the day for family activities.

**Pawnee, Oklahoma:** I celebrate my two grandmothers who were born
on the 4th of July. My mother's mother, Lillie Carson (Otoe), and my
dad's grandmother, Sally Kaulaity (Kiowa). They were both good
grandmothers. I miss them.

**Santa Fe, New Mexico:** We chose to get married on the 4th of
July. Having our anniversary on that day makes the day about love
and the continuity of my Cherokee family and the families of all the
cultures we've married with over the generations. It adds nuance to
a day that could just be about patriotism and blowing things
up. Plus we always have the day off and get to spend the day with
family and friends who believe in the importance of journeying
together in peace and equality. And yes, we get fireworks, too.

**Waldorf, Maryland:** Yes. We have our homecoming then. It never
feels like a 4th of July celebration even though it is. It feels
more like what we call it, Lumbee Homecoming. We have thousands of
people packed in one little town for nine days celebrating our
people, our food and culture, their talent, or their coming back
home to visit relatives, spending time together, and making new
memories, and of course enjoying eating grape ice cream.

**Shawnee, Oklahoma:** The flag of the United States is not
exclusively the flag of the immigrants who came here and created a
government, it is also the flag that our own warriors defended many
times in the last century and currently today. Yes, it was once
flown by our enemy, but it now represents those warriors who fought
under it and all those who work toward fulfillment of tribal
sovereignty and treaty rights and an inclusive country where
immigrants and indigenous people live together equally protected
under the Constitution. It is a symbol of the treaty agreements that
we as indigenous people still have our inherent rights. Okay, that's
not a celebration but that's what I think when I celebrate.

**Oklahoma City:** Do as our people always have: Help feed and care
for those who need it!

**Carnegie, Oklahoma:** We celebrate every 4th Gourd Dancing,
camping, and visiting my Kiowa people while we're here, listening to
the beautiful Kiowa songs. For three days we are just in Kiowa
heaven. Been doing this for years. Now my parents have gone on, but
we will continue to attend the Kiowa Gourd Dance Celebration.

**Oklahoma City, Oklahoma:** Do American Indians celebrate the 4th
of July? Yes, it represents freedom in the United States of
America. Freedom to continue to worship Creator, freedom to dance my
prayers, freedom to sweat, freedom to rise early and pray the day in
and be up late to pray the day out. We, the Host People, celebrate
the 4th of July every day!

**Prewitt, New Mexico, and the Navajo Nation:** No, I do not
celebrate. Because I as a Dine will never relinquish my belief or
understanding that we as a people and a nation have the right to be
loyal to the Holy Ones before all others, including the United
States. We as a people existed long before there ever was a United
States.

**Taos, New Mexico:** Taos is a very close-knit community, and even
more so at Taos Pueblo nearby. Both have had many citizens serve in
America's military in the heartfelt belief that they are protecting
our nation. One of our honored tribal elders is Tony Reyna, 97, who
survived the Bataan Death March during World War II. I have been
told many times that, for us, the idea of protection goes deeper
than for most Americans. This land is where our people emerged, and
any threat to it is met from a place of deep, deep meaning. People
here celebrate Independence Day pretty much as they do
everywhere. It's a day off, and there are parades and fireworks
displays. But for many we remember World War II, Korea, Vietnam,
Iraq and Afghanistan, and the sacrifices our people made. I wish all
people could remember that.

**Parshall, North Dakota, and the Three Affiliated Tribes:** The 4th
is the celebration of independence, which Native people have
practiced as sovereign nations for generations.

**Shawnee, Oklahoma:** No, I do not celebrate Independence Day,
simply because the Declaration of Independence labels my people "our
enemies, the merciless savages of our frontiers." You notice the
colonists were already calling the frontiers "ours" when the land
was not theirs. Because I do not celebrate Independence Day does not
mean I am not proud of our Native American veterans and soldiers. I
am very proud of them and of the fact almost all Native American
families have a family member who is a veteran or an active member
in the Armed Forces.

**Anadarko, Oklahoma:** I am Kiowa/Delaware/Absentee Shawnee. My mom
is a Kiowa/Comanche. My uncle is a vet, as many of my other
relatives are, as well as my stepdad (Comanche/Caddo). My Delaware
grandma always said, "This is not our holiday. Out of respect we
will honor their day, because our people helped them." She said, "I
will mourn on this day." She would wear a black dress that day.

**Laguna, New Mexico, and the Pueblos of Acoma and Laguna:** I
celebrate the 4th of July and I do so proudly. . . . When you have
been lucky enough to travel and see life in other places, you come
to appreciate the home and land you live on. Maybe I'm not as bitter
as some of my other Indigenous brothers and sisters because my
tribes were not relocated and have been lucky to remain on ancestral
lands. Our Pueblo people . . . fought against the Spanish in the
Pueblo Revolt, but also learned to harmonize with the Catholic
Church. Many years--even centuries--of healing have taken place to
get us to this point. And I think by celebrating the 4th of July, I
feel I am honoring that healing my Pueblo ancestors have prayed
for. . . .

**Sawmill, Arizona, and the Navajo Nation:** I recognize
Independence Day as a day off, as time with family. I recognize that
the United States declared its independence on that day, but Native
people weren't a part of their envisioned emancipation. As Native
people, we recognized our independence through our prayers and
practicing our traditions. We didn't need a special day to mark our
freedom, we just were. So on the 4th of July, I will practice my
American heritage and celebrate this country's Independence Day. But
my heart knows I don't need a day to recognize my autonomy.

**Oklahoma City and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma: **I think of the
4th of July as American Ideals Day. If only America would live up to
its own stated ideals, none of what happened to American Indian
people would have happened. Today, if those ideals were finally
acted upon, American Indian sovereignty would be fully recognized
and the treaties would be kept intact. The fireworks celebrate the
great ideals that could be America, if only greed were not allowed
to pervert them.

**Norman, Oklahoma:** My 13-year-old son (Comanche/Cherokee) is
currently reading the U.S. Constitution (just because). When I asked
him about the 4th the other day, he kind of shook his head and said
that most people just don't get it. Reading the comment above on
American Ideals Day made me think of how true it is--how little we
know about America's ideals of the past and where we hold them now.

**Wichita, Kansas:** My people, Kiowas, have always held this time
of the year as a gathering of all our bands. They would celebrate
for a week, indulging in each society's dances, renewing
friendships, visiting relatives, and so on. As we progressed into
this modern society we are a part of, we recognized the importance
of this celebration even more so. To honor our freedoms and the men
and women who sacrificed for us today is truly a reason to celebrate
the 4th of July. Does it mean we are to forget our struggles and the
plight of our people? NO, but it commemorates the beauty of our land
and the resolve of this nation we call America.

**Pawnee, Oklahoma:** [It's a day] to celebrate all our Native men
and women who served in the Armed Forces of the United States of
America, our Native men [the Codetalkers] without whose tribal
language [World War II] might have been lost. To honor our fallen
ones, who sacrified their lives for us, and the veterans who are
buried in our tribal cemeteries . . . and overseas. To honor my
daughter . . . in the U.S. Army, a proud Native American woman who
is serving our country.

**Waikoloa, Hawai'i, via the Red Cloud Indian School, Pine Ridge,
South Dakota:** It is a sad time, . . . thinking of all the treaties
never honored. I try to hold my children and grandcubs near and
invite others who are alone or ill or elderly to eat lots of food
that I cook until I am very tired and thank the Creator for another
wonderful day.

MR. McMAHON: John Trudell.
</p>

<p>
JOHN TRUDELL,
</p>

<p>
called as a witness, being first duly sworn, testified and
</p>

<p>
said as follows:
</p>

<p>
DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. McMAHON:
</p>

<p>
Q. State your name, please?
</p>

<p>
A. My name is John Trudell.
</p>

<p>
Q. Where do you live, Mr. Trudell?
</p>

<p>
A. In Los Angeles, California.
</p>

<p>
Q. How long have you lived in California?
</p>

<p>
A. Since about 1979.
</p>

<p>
Q. What is your occupation?
</p>

<p>
A. I am a writer and a performer, actor, speaker, in that area.
</p>

<p>
Q. You currently have a band?
</p>

<p>
A. Yeah, Bad Dog.
</p>

<p>
Q. Have you been an entertainer for quite a while?
</p>

<p>
A. Twenty years.
</p>

<p>
Q. Where were you born and raised?
</p>

<p>
A. I was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and I was raised in small
</p>

<p>
communities around Omaha, and my reservation is Sante in
</p>

<p>
Northern Nebraska. So I enlisted when I was seventeen, and up
</p>

<p>
until that time maybe I had lived in both communities, both
</p>

<p>
worlds equally.
</p>

<p>
Q. You did what at seventeen?
</p>

<p>
A. I enlisted in the Navy.
</p>

<p>
Q. In the Navy, okay. How long were you in the Navy?
</p>

<p>
A. Four years. Three years and ten months.
</p>

<p>
Q. Where did you go after that?
</p>

<p>
A. I stayed in southern California, because I was home
</p>

<p>
ported in Long Beach. I went to school for a while in San
</p>

<p>
Bernardino, and figured out that wasn't really working out for
</p>

<p>
me, and then I went to the Alcatraz occupation in 1969.
</p>

<p>
Q. What do you had mean by the Alcatraz occupation?
</p>

<p>
A. In 1969 collective native community, we called ourselves
</p>

<p>
Indians of all Tribes Alcatraz, but we occupied the former
</p>

<p>
prison under the 1868, in relationship to the 1868 Fort
</p>

<p>
Laramie treaty about surplus government lands reverting to
</p>

<p>
native use.
</p>

<p>
Q. About 1969 or so did you become somewhat of an activist?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, 100 percent.
</p>

<p>
Q. How old are you now?
</p>

<p>
A. I will be 58 next week.
</p>

<p>
Q. Have you ever been involved with the AIM organization?
</p>

<p>
A. I was chairman of AIM from 1973 to around 1979.
</p>

<p>
Q. What did you do as chairman of AIM?
</p>

<p>
A. Me, I think basically I acted as a spokesman. You know,
</p>

<p>
really what, I mean the title is chairman, but in reality I
</p>

<p>
acted as a spokesman. I looked at that as what my role was.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't so much, because AIM at that time with the
</p>

<p>
leadership, you know, we all had different supporters. I mean
</p>

<p>
each leader had their own group of people around them, but I
</p>

<p>
never really looked at my role as being an order giver, it was
</p>

<p>
more to speak, because that is, I always felt that's why.
</p>

<p>
When I was nominated to be, actually was named cochairman, and
</p>

<p>
there was an incident and I became chairman, but I always felt
</p>

<p>
it was the people liked my analysis of things.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did you know Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash?
</p>

<p>
A. Pardon?
</p>

<p>
Q. Did you know Anna Mae Aquash?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, I did.
</p>

<p>
Q. When did you first meet her?
</p>

<p>
A. I met her at, I think it was in Minneapolis, but it was
</p>

<p>
at an Indian education conference in Minneapolis. I think it
</p>

<p>
was the summer of 1970. July or August, something like that.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did you become friends with her?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, I did.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did you see her occasionally off and on since 1970 then?
</p>

<p>
A. I didn't see her again until in the summer of '70, and I
</p>

<p>
think the next time I remember seeing her was in 1974 at the
</p>

<p>
Means-Banks trial in St. Paul.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did you ever see her in 1975?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, I did.
</p>

<p>
Q. What time of the year did you see her?
</p>

<p>
A. I saw her in, at the Farmington AIM conference or
</p>

<p>
convention in, that would have been in June of 1975. I saw
</p>

<p>
her then, and then I saw her again in September of 1975 in Los 
</p>

<p>
Angeles.
</p>

<p>
Q. So when you saw her at the Farmington convention did you
</p>

<p>
have any conversations with her?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, I did.
</p>

<p>
Q. Was she concerned about anything at that time?
</p>

<p>
A. She was concerned because she had been accused of being
</p>

<p>
an informant, and because we had some discussion about that,
</p>

<p>
but at the time my feeling was, what I got out of it, she was
</p>

<p>
just more angry. I didn't sense really it was about fear, but
</p>

<p>
she was really upset that people were making this accusation
</p>

<p>
to her.
</p>

<p>
Q. After the Farmington convention, when was it that you
</p>

<p>
saw her next?
</p>

<p>
A. Pardon.
</p>

<p>
Q. When did you see her next after that convention?
</p>

<p>
A. After that I saw her in Los Angeles, I think it was
</p>

<p>
September of '75.
</p>

<p>
Q. Where was that that you saw her in LA?
</p>

<p>
A. Anna Mae and Miwak (Nilak) Butler had arrived in LA and had 
</p>

<p>
been detained at LAX, and Miwak (Nilak) Butler was taken and 
</p>

<p>
locked up at the civil brand center, and Anna Mae was cut loose. So I
</p>

<p>
spent time with her. There was a Chuck Salazar, Ernie Peters
</p>

<p>
and myself, and the White Bear family.
</p>

<p>
Q. I am sorry, the what?
</p>

<p>
A. White Bear. So, and at that time because Miwak had been
</p>

<p>
arrested, and all of this was going on in relationship to the
</p>

<p>
fire fight in Oglala the previous summer. Between Chuck and
</p>

<p>
Ernie and myself we tried to, one of us always stayed with her
</p>

<p>
as much as possible just to act in the capacity of being security.
</p>

<p>
Q. Who was Anna Mae staying with while she was in
</p>

<p>
California then?
</p>

<p>
A. Between White Bear's and I think maybe one evening or so
</p>

<p>
she might have spent at Chuck Salazar's, and but basically at
</p>

<p>
the White Bear family.
</p>

<p>
Q. What was her state of mind at that time?
</p>

<p>
A. At that time she, it was about more than being angry,
</p>

<p>
she was afraid.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did she leave while you were still there?
</p>

<p>
A. Pardon?
</p>

<p>
Q. I mean did you, were you in California when she left
</p>

<p>
California, let me ask it that way?
</p>

<p>
A. Chuck Salazar, Ernie Peters and myself, we took her to
</p>

<p>
the airport.
</p>

<p>
Q. You know where she was going?
</p>

<p>
A. She was going to Denver.
</p>

<p>
Q. You know why she was going to Denver?
</p>

<p>
A. No, I don't know why she was. She didn't say, but
</p>

<p>
somebody had gotten in touch with her, and I don't know who it
</p>

<p>
was, but someone had gotten in touch with her to go to Denver.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did you ever see Anna Mae again?
</p>

<p>
A. No.
</p>

<p>
Q. So September of '75 would have been the last time that
</p>

<p>
you saw her?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did you ever talk with her on the phone after that?
</p>

<p>
A. No.
</p>

<p>
Q. How did you find out she had been killed?
</p>

<p>
A. I found out that she was killed, it was in a
</p>

<p>
conversation I had with Dennis Banks in Berkley some time in
</p>

<p>
'76. February, March, some time in '76. At this time I
</p>

<p>
didn't know there had been a body found, and Dennis mentioned
</p>

<p>
to me, he said, well, that body they found in Pine Ridge or
</p>

<p>
Wanblee, he said I think it is Anna Mae. This was the first
</p>

<p>
that I had known.
</p>

<p>
Q. Now prior to discovering that she had been killed, did
</p>

<p>
you ever receive anything that made you believe she was in danger?
</p>

<p>
A. Well, two things. I mean in September when I saw her,
</p>

<p>
because she was afraid, and she told me at that time, you
</p>

<p>
know, she had had a run-in with David Price and that Price was
</p>

<p>
trying to get her to tell about the Oglala fire fight, and in
</p>

<p>
the course of that she swore at him, and then he said to her
</p>

<p>
that he would see her dead within the year. And she was upset
</p>

<p>
about that. So when she came and I saw her in September, she
</p>

<p>
said to me, you know, that if you ever want to, if you had to
</p>

<p>
go somewhere, she would go, there was an island where she grew
</p>

<p>
up, and that would be the place she would go that would be
</p>

<p>
safe for her. Then she told me to, that in the rain, she
</p>

<p>
loved the rain, and to always remember her in the rain, and we
</p>

<p>
had this conversation, and at that time her fear was about
</p>

<p>
that. She was angry because still accusations, name calling
</p>

<p>
about her being an informant or a pig, she was angry about
</p>

<p>
that, and then now, but then now the element of fear has been
</p>

<p>
added because of this dialogue she said that she had. Then
</p>

<p>
after she had been arrested in the mobile home incident in
</p>

<p>
Oregon, so this would have been around the end of November or
</p>

<p>
December, I don't remember the exact time, but I got a letter
</p>

<p>
and a ring from her that was delivered through Mathalene White Bear.
</p>

<p>
Q. Who's ring was it?
</p>

<p>
A. It was Anna Mae's ring.
</p>

<p>
Q. How did you know that?
</p>

<p>
A. Because Anna Mae and I had an understanding that just
</p>

<p>
because the way things were at that time if she needed to
</p>

<p>
communicate with me, that she would send this ring, because
</p>

<p>
then I would know somebody wasn't playing a bunch of games.
</p>

<p>
Q. You also said you received a letter.
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. Do you still have that letter?
</p>

<p>
A. No, it burned down in my, there was a fire in my home in
</p>

<p>
1979 and it burned.
</p>

<p>
Q. Do you know Arlo Looking Cloud?
</p>

<p>
A. I have met Arlo once that I can remember.
</p>

<p>
Q. You see him in the courtroom today?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. Would you point out where he is seated, please?
</p>

<p>
A. Sitting right there. (Indicating).
</p>

<p>
MR. McMAHON: May the record reflect he pointed to
</p>

<p>
the defendant. Your Honor?
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: It may.
</p>

<p>
BY MR. McMAHON:
</p>

<p>
Q. Have you ever had an occasion to visit with Mr. Looking
</p>

<p>
Cloud about Anna Mae's death?
</p>

<p>
A. One time, in 1988.
</p>

<p>
Q. Where was that at?
</p>

<p>
A. My band, we were on tour with a band called Midnight
</p>

<p>
Oil, and we played in Denver, and I saw him then after the
</p>

<p>
show.
</p>

<p>
Q. How is it that you had a conversation with Mr. Looking Cloud?
</p>

<p>
A. Troy Lynn brought him, Troy Lynn had said to me that
</p>

<p>
Arlo wanted to talk with me.
</p>

<p>
Q. Troy Lynn Yellow Wood?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes. So she brought Arlo to where I was at.
</p>

<p>
Q. And where were you at when you saw Mr. Looking Cloud?
</p>

<p>
A. I think it was in my hotel room in Denver.
</p>

<p>
Q. Who was present during this conversation?
</p>

<p>
A. Myself, Troy Lynn and Arlo.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did Mr. Looking Cloud talk to you about what had
</p>

<p>
happened to Anna Mae?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, he did.
</p>

<p>
Q. What do you remember about him telling you what had
</p>

<p>
happened to her?
</p>

<p>
A. Well, first, I mean I was surprised that he was coming
</p>

<p>
to talk to me about this.
</p>

<p>
Q. You didn't know him at that time?
</p>

<p>
A. No, I may have met him. But, no, I didn't know him. So
</p>

<p>
he told me that he and John Boy and Theda, they had taken her
</p>

<p>
from Troy Lynn's house in Denver, and that they brought her to
</p>

<p>
a place in Rapid City, they took her to one house, one place,
</p>

<p>
and then from there to an empty apartment or house, and that
</p>

<p>
this house belonged to Thelma Rios, and that they kept Anna
</p>

<p>
Mae there for maybe a day. And that while she was there that
</p>

<p>
Laurelie Means and Madonna Thunder Hawk and Thelma Rios and
</p>

<p>
John Boy and himself, between them, somebody always stayed
</p>

<p>
with her, and she was kept in that house not free to leave.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did he ever mention to you why Anna Mae had been taken
</p>

<p>
to South Dakota?
</p>

<p>
A. To be questioned.
</p>

<p>
Q. About what?
</p>

<p>
A. Being an informant.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did he tell you where they went once they left Rapid City?
</p>

<p>
A. The best I can remember what he said was that they were
</p>

<p>
in Rapid City maybe 24 hours, a day or so, something along
</p>

<p>
that time line, and then they took her to a house near the
</p>

<p>
Indian hospital in Rosebud.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did he say what happened at that house in Rosebud?
</p>

<p>
A. During this whole process that Anna Mae was trying to
</p>

<p>
get them to let her go, talking to them about letting her go,
</p>

<p>
and that she was very afraid. Then they took her, so then
</p>

<p>
when they went to this house near the Indian hospital, then
</p>

<p>
Arlo stayed in the car with Anna Mae and John Boy and Theda
</p>

<p>
went in the house.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did he say if Anna Mae and he had any type of a
</p>

<p>
conversation?
</p>

<p>
A. Is that she was just asking them to let her go. She
</p>

<p>
wanted to be free, she was afraid, you know, and basically it
</p>

<p>
was that kind of, but I don't know if that is really a
</p>

<p>
conversation. She is saying to him she wants to, would he let her go.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did he ever mention to you that they had also stopped in 
</p>

<p>
Pine Ridge?
</p>

<p>
A. I don't remember him telling me that.
</p>

<p>
Q. He didn't ever mention to you that they stopped at a
</p>

<p>
house in Allen?
</p>

<p>
A. I don't, I truly don't remember it. I mean he may have
</p>

<p>
said it, but I don't remember that.
</p>

<p>
Q. So what did he tell you happened once they left the
</p>

<p>
house in Rosebud?
</p>

<p>
A. Well, John Boy and Theda came out of the house, and that
</p>

<p>
they got in the car and they basically drove up to the place
</p>

<p>
near Wanblee where she was shot.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did he tell you what happened at the site where she was shot?
</p>

<p>
A. That they had, that he and John Boy and Anna Mae got out
</p>

<p>
of the car, and that they walked Anna Mae to a spot where she
</p>

<p>
was shot, and in the course of this walk that Anna Mae was
</p>

<p>
crying, praying, talking about her daughters. She didn't want
</p>

<p>
to lose her daughters, and what were they going to do, please
</p>

<p>
let her go, and things of that nature, and then she knelt,
</p>

<p>
that John Boy had her kneel down, and John Boy shot her in the
</p>

<p>
back of the head.
</p>

<p>
MR. McMAHON: That's all I have.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: Cross exam.
</p>

<p>
CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. RENSCH:
</p>

<p>
Q. Morning, sir. Or almost afternoon I guess it is. In
</p>

<p>
this conversation that you had with Arlo, what year was that?
</p>

<p>
A. 1988.
</p>

<p>
Q. Who else was present during that conversation?
</p>

<p>
A. Troy Lynn.
</p>

<p>
Q. Was she adding to the conversation at all?
</p>

<p>
A. Pardon?
</p>

<p>
Q. Was she talking at the time?
</p>

<p>
A. She may have been, but I don't really remember that.
</p>

<p>
Q. You had spoken to Troy Lynn prior to meeting with Arlo,
</p>

<p>
had you not?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. And she had told you what she thought Arlo would say to
</p>

<p>
you, isn't that correct?
</p>

<p>
A. No, that's not correct.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did she tell you anything about?
</p>

<p>
A. She said he wanted to talk to me, that he wanted to talk
</p>

<p>
to me, but it was about what happened with Anna Mae, it was in
</p>

<p>
relationship to Anna Mae.
</p>

<p>
Q. Where did this conversation take place with Arlo?
</p>

<p>
A. In a hotel room.
</p>

<p>
Q. In a hotel room?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. Is there any possibility it took place in a car?
</p>

<p>
A. We may have went down to the car from there, but
</p>

<p>
basically because they came to my room.
</p>

<p>
Q. First of all, you didn't write any notes of this or
</p>

<p>
anything like that, did you, sir?
</p>

<p>
A. No.
</p>

<p>
Q. I suppose that through the years because you knew
</p>

<p>
Ms. Pictou-Aquash that if something comes out on this subject
</p>

<p>
you would read it if you could?
</p>

<p>
A. I would what?
</p>

<p>
Q. Read something that comes out on this subject, isn't
</p>

<p>
that correct?
</p>

<p>
A. Well, maybe, because it depends on who is writing it,
</p>

<p>
because a lot of people write things that have no basis to reality.
</p>

<p>
Q. It seems to me that at some point in this case you have
</p>

<p>
made a statement to somebody to the effect that it is kind of
</p>

<p>
hard to keep it all straight, what you have read and what you
</p>

<p>
have heard and things like that. You recall anything like that?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, I do, and it was in regard to a specific statement.
</p>

<p>
Q. Now when we are talking about then what Arlo is telling
</p>

<p>
you in this vehicle, or in the hotel room, as the case may be?
</p>

<p>
A. In the course of the evening.
</p>

<p>
Q. When ever he was there. Can you, as you sit there
</p>

<p>
today, specifically recall him telling you names of people in
</p>

<p>
Rapid City, or could you have filled that information in?
</p>

<p>
A. He told me the names, because I did not -- he told me
</p>

<p>
those names, there is no mistake about this.
</p>

<p>
Q. There is no mistake about that?
</p>

<p>
A. No mistake about this.
</p>

<p>
Q. And this conversation occurred I think we have
</p>

<p>
established was it '88?
</p>

<p>
A. In 1988.
</p>

<p>
Q. 1988, okay. Did he ever say anything to you about
</p>

<p>
wanting Ms. Pictou-Aquash to die?
</p>

<p>
A. No. I mean no, he didn't say that. The impression I
</p>

<p>
got was that he didn't know what the end result was going to
</p>

<p>
be. That I will say that, but it happened, and he played his role.
</p>

<p>
Q. When you were speaking to him, was it clear to you that
</p>

<p>
the fact that she was killed was a surprise to him?
</p>

<p>
A. I got the impression, I don't know about surprise, but
</p>

<p>
up until the time they left that house. See after they left
</p>

<p>
that house, I don't know about surprises any more, alright,
</p>

<p>
because somebody said to do this, but up until the time they
</p>

<p>
went to that house I don't think he expected that she would be killed.
</p>

<p>
Q. You just said at that house somebody said to do this?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. What are you referring to?
</p>

<p>
A. Well, John Boy and Arlo and Theda, they weren't decision
</p>

<p>
makers. I mean they couldn't give this kind. It wasn't their
</p>

<p>
idea to go down there and pick her up, it wasn't their idea.
</p>

<p>
They did what they were told.
</p>

<p>
Q. You have told us what Arlo told you already, and I don't
</p>

<p>
recall you saying anything about him saying that someone
</p>

<p>
issued an order or said anything at that house. Do you recall
</p>

<p>
him saying that anybody at that house said anything about
</p>

<p>
Ms. Pictou-Aquash being killed?
</p>

<p>
A. John Boy and Theda went in that house, and when they
</p>

<p>
came out it was with the instructions to kill her.
</p>

<p>
Q. That's what Arlo told you?
</p>

<p>
A. I almost say it verbatim in those exact words, but that
</p>

<p>
was the impression of what I got out of what he told me.
</p>

<p>
Q. I am not trying to nitpick with you.
</p>

<p>
A. I understand.
</p>

<p>
Q. I nitpick with you, but it is very, very important. I
</p>

<p>
want to know if you heard from Arlo's mouth something about
</p>

<p>
him knowing that she was going to be killed in advance of her
</p>

<p>
death? Did you hear anything in that regard?
</p>

<p>
A. Up until the time they went to that house, my opinion he
</p>

<p>
didn't know she was going to be killed, but when they left
</p>

<p>
that house they knew.
</p>

<p>
Q. Arlo told you they knew?
</p>

<p>
A. They took her out and shot her. Somewhere in there, so
</p>

<p>
I mean --
</p>

<p>
Q. Well, we are here about what Arlo said, and did Arlo
</p>

<p>
tell you that he knew, or are you making that assumption?
</p>

<p>
A. I am very careful about making an assumption on this.
</p>

<p>
It is just that when John Boy and Theda came out of that
</p>

<p>
house, because Theda took Anna Mae's jewelry, took some of her
</p>

<p>
jewelry.
</p>

<p>
Q. So as you are talking to us now you remember Arlo saying
</p>

<p>
something about Theda taking Anna Mae's jewelry?
</p>

<p>
A. Somewhere in the course of that, yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. Is that something that you could have read, sir?
</p>

<p>
A. No. Certain things I remember because I had not heard
</p>

<p>
them before. I can't remember the point that you are going
</p>

<p>
to, but there was something I had been asked, and I wasn't
</p>

<p>
sure if I had read that part.
</p>

<p>
Q. Mr. McMahon had asked you what Arlo had said, and I
</p>

<p>
don't recall you saying anything about jewelry. Maybe I missed it.
</p>

<p>
A. Maybe I forgot to say it to him, but the deal is --
</p>

<p>
Q. Because you and I have had a telephone conversation?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, we have.
</p>

<p>
Q. Didn't you say to me that this is a situation of Arlo
</p>

<p>
being in the wrong place at the wrong time?
</p>

<p>
A. That's my feeling.
</p>

<p>
Q. Didn't you say to me that from everything Arlo told you
</p>

<p>
that this was a complete surprise on his part?
</p>

<p>
A. Something to that effect.
</p>

<p>
Q. I guess I am asking you if you would say something to
</p>

<p>
the effect that from what Arlo told you, this was a complete
</p>

<p>
surprise on his part, why the change?
</p>

<p>
A. I don't think I am changing. See, because it all hinges
</p>

<p>
at that house, alright, because I think there was a complete
</p>

<p>
surprise to him that that decision had been made.
</p>

<p>
Q. Well, do you know at what point he became aware of the
</p>

<p>
decision, did he tell you?
</p>

<p>
A. When he got out of that car and started walking to where
</p>

<p>
she was killed.
</p>

<p>
Q. What did he say about that?
</p>

<p>
A. They got out of the car, and they had the gun and they
</p>

<p>
walked to the thing. So now I am making an assumption, okay,
</p>

<p>
I am making an assumption he knew by then that something was
</p>

<p>
going to happen.
</p>

<p>
Q. You use the word they, it includes a lot of people?
</p>

<p>
A. John Boy and Arlo got out of that car with Anna Mae and
</p>

<p>
walked her to that spot.
</p>

<p>
Q. Arlo never said he had the gun, did he?
</p>

<p>
A. No, he never said he had the gun.
</p>

<p>
Q. He didn't know that John Boy had the gun, would you agree?
</p>

<p>
A. No, I can't agree or disagree with that.
</p>

<p>
Q. You don't know?
</p>

<p>
A. Right.
</p>

<p>
Q. And that John Boy shot her, and that was a surprise to
</p>

<p>
Arlo that she would be shot?
</p>

<p>
A. I don't know.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did he say that to you?
</p>

<p>
A. Did he say that it was a surprise to him.
</p>

<p>
Q. It was a surprise when she was killed?
</p>

<p>
A. No, he didn't use those words.
</p>

<p>
Q. What words did he use that led you to say to me that
</p>

<p>
something to the effect this was a surprise to him?
</p>

<p>
A. He was picking Anna Mae up in Denver and taking her to
</p>

<p>
the house, wherever she was held here in Rapid and then taking
</p>

<p>
her to the house in Rosebud, alright. I had the feeling that
</p>

<p>
none of those three that took her up to that point really knew
</p>

<p>
what the outcome was going to be, because somebody was telling
</p>

<p>
them what to do. But when they left that house, somebody
</p>

<p>
amongst them knew what was going to happen. So to me I would
</p>

<p>
say that the surprise, Arlo was surprised that this happened
</p>

<p>
to her, but it was after that visit to that house.
</p>

<p>
Q. You just said that you think that somebody knew what was
</p>

<p>
going to happen when they left that house, right, sir?
</p>

<p>
Somebody in that car?
</p>

<p>
A. Somebody did.
</p>

<p>
Q. But Arlo didn't tell you that he knew what was going to
</p>

<p>
happen when they left that house, did he?
</p>

<p>
A. The best I remember what he said was that when John Boy
</p>

<p>
and Theda came out of that house, they took her where she was
</p>

<p>
shot, and then he and John Boy got out of the car, alright,
</p>

<p>
and walked her to where she was at, alright, and John Boy had
</p>

<p>
her kneel down and shot her in the back of the head. And if I
</p>

<p>
remember correctly, there was something about maybe a blanket
</p>

<p>
or something, but I may be confused about that.
</p>

<p>
Q. So you are telling us what he said, you are remembering,
</p>

<p>
you are visualizing him talking to you wherever it was you
</p>

<p>
were talking and trying to tell us also what he said?
</p>

<p>
A. I mean he said what he said to me, yes, he did.
</p>

<p>
Q. As you recounted all this you didn't say anything about
</p>

<p>
her begging for her life, or saying please don't shoot me, or
</p>

<p>
mentioning anything about her kids?
</p>

<p>
A. Say this again.
</p>

<p>
Q. As you just told us what you he said happened?
</p>

<p>
A. He told me about her begging for her life and her kid.
</p>

<p>
Q. Is your position he told you she was begging for her
</p>

<p>
life on the walk out to the ravine?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. And sir, you don't know whether she was begging when
</p>

<p>
Theda and John Boy went in to this house by the Indian
</p>

<p>
hospital from his conversation?
</p>

<p>
A. No, she was.
</p>

<p>
Q. You are telling us that he told you she was begging when
</p>

<p>
they went in to the house, is that right?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. And that when the other two of course went in the house
</p>

<p>
he would be in the car alone with her?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. I want to ask you if you, now you have spoken with an
</p>

<p>
individual about this matter and that was tape recorded, have
</p>

<p>
you not?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. You know an individual by the name of Neil (Serle) Chapman?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. He interviewed you about this, did he not?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did you know he was taping it as he was interviewing you?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did you say this to him, and I am at page 8.
</p>

<p>
MR. McMAHON: Excuse me, Your Honor, I believe this
</p>

<p>
is improper impeachment, he can refresh his recollection?
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: True.
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: Can we approach for a moment, please?
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: You may.
</p>

<p>
( Bench Conference)
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: This is a prior inconsistency, it need
</p>

<p>
not be under oath. I can ask him if he was asked the question
</p>

<p>
and he denies it, then he has access to the document. I am
</p>

<p>
looking at a prior inconsistent statement in this interview
</p>

<p>
and it's my intent to ask him if he made the statement.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: You haven't asked him yet.
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: No, I haven't, I think it's my choice
</p>

<p>
if I want to let him refresh his recollection or ask him outright.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: You were referring to the pages were you
</p>

<p>
impeaching him before you asked the question.
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: I was just doing that so counsel would
</p>

<p>
know where I was at. Do you want me to do some other
</p>

<p>
procedure, I think I can, but I think I am allowed to say did
</p>

<p>
you say this, and if he didn't, he can deny it, and it would
</p>

<p>
be my option to bring in the person who made the statement to
</p>

<p>
tie it up. I don't think I have to throw it in front of him
</p>

<p>
to ask him the question.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: You haven't asked the question yet, I
</p>

<p>
think that's the point.
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: Do you want me to put it in front of him.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: What you do is up to you, but you
</p>

<p>
haven't asked a predicate question yet that you have either to
</p>

<p>
refresh him with or impeach him with.
</p>

<p>
MR. McMAHON: I thought he was going to try to
</p>

<p>
impeach him, and there wasn't anything pending.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: That's what I thought, too, but I think
</p>

<p>
we have that ironed out, I think.
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: So everybody knows, the predicate
</p>

<p>
questions I asked him about him claiming that she was begging
</p>

<p>
in the car, that's what this impeaches, that's why I was
</p>

<p>
asking those previous questions.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: Let me look at what you are looking at.
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: Right here.
</p>

<p>
MR. McMAHON: I don't think that even talks about it.
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: I think a prior inconsistent statement.
</p>

<p>
MR. McMAHON: Why is it inconsistent?
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: Because he said she was begging in the
</p>

<p>
car, here it says she wasn't. It says what ever she was
</p>

<p>
stating to him when she was by herself with him in the car.
</p>

<p>
MR. McMAHON: What ever she was saying, it doesn't
</p>

<p>
say she wasn't saying.
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: If she wasn't saying, that would imply.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: I don't think so, but you can do what
</p>

<p>
you want, but that doesn't mean I am not going to sustain an
</p>

<p>
objection, we will see.
</p>

<p>
(End Bench Conference ).
</p>

<p>
BY MR. RENSCH:
</p>

<p>
Q. Sir, you have just indicated to us that
</p>

<p>
Ms. Pictou-Aquash was saying things to Arlo while he was alone
</p>

<p>
in the car, and that's what Arlo had reported to you, okay. I
</p>

<p>
would like to ask you if you made this statement on another
</p>

<p>
occasion. Page 8. Statement by you. And he and Anna Mae
</p>

<p>
stayed in the car, and what ever he was saying, and I don't,
</p>

<p>
see what I think is I don't think that whatever she was saying
</p>

<p>
to him when he was by himself with her in that car, I think
</p>

<p>
she was saying the same things to the rest of them when they
</p>

<p>
were going. Did you make that statement, sir?
</p>

<p>
A. Say that again, it's confusing.
</p>

<p>
Q. Here, let me show it to you. So much for that.
</p>

<p>
A. Yeah, I probably said that, but I don't, I am confused
</p>

<p>
by the question.
</p>

<p>
Q. You don't really remember where it was that Arlo was
</p>

<p>
saying Ms. Pictou-Aquash was asking to be let go, do you, sir?
</p>

<p>
A. No, I do remember. It was in the car, because when John
</p>

<p>
Boy and Theda went in to that house, alright, she was having
</p>

<p>
this conversation with him not to, about to let her go, her begging.
</p>

<p>
Q. What did he say his response was to her?
</p>

<p>
A. That he couldn't do anything.
</p>

<p>
Q. Did he say anything to her about not thinking that she
</p>

<p>
was going to be killed that you recall?
</p>

<p>
A. No, not that I recall.
</p>

<p>
Q. Do you know an individual by the name of John Graham?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, I do.
</p>

<p>
Q. How do you know him?
</p>

<p>
A. Well, I met John Boy, I know him as John Boy, but I met
</p>

<p>
him in the spring of 1976.
</p>

<p>
Q. Okay. You sundanced with him, didn't you?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, I did.
</p>

<p>
Q. What does that mean to sundance with somebody?
</p>

<p>
A. I can't say what it means for everybody. For me, you
</p>

<p>
know, it is like, it is making an offering, it's an offering
</p>

<p>
of yourself either in return for help that has been given, or,
</p>

<p>
so it is a personal physical sacrifice that is part of a
</p>

<p>
mental psychological sacrifice that you make to the people for
</p>

<p>
this endurance.
</p>

<p>
Q. Do you do that in a circle?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. Was John Boy in the circle?
</p>

<p>
A. He was sundancing, yes, he was.
</p>

<p>
Q. After that point did John Boy take on some position of
</p>

<p>
prominence within the American Indian Movement?
</p>

<p>
A. Not that I recall. I mean when you say position of
</p>

<p>
prominence, I can't say that.
</p>

<p>
Q. He continued to remain active in the American Indian
</p>

<p>
Movement ?
</p>

<p>
A. See, during this time in '76 the Butler Robin (Robideau) trial on
</p>

<p>
the FBI thing was taking place in Cedar Rapids, and then I
</p>

<p>
went to the sundance. Actually maybe it had already, the
</p>

<p>
trial was over, and then I went to the sundance. And John Boy
</p>

<p>
was there, because I had some involvement with him there at
</p>

<p>
the sundance, and then I don't really remember seeing John Boy
</p>

<p>
again until 1980. I am not going to say I didn't, or '79 and
</p>

<p>
'80. So he kind of, I mean see I lived in my own reality, my
</p>

<p>
family was in Nevada, and I was doing what I was doing. So I
</p>

<p>
wasn't around a lot of activities, but I don't remember seeing
</p>

<p>
John Boy again until about '80, '79 or '80.
</p>

<p>
Q. If you were friends with Anna Mae, why, if Arlo said
</p>

<p>
these things to you in '88, why didn't you call the police and
</p>

<p>
do something about it?
</p>

<p>
A. Because I told Arlo that I would say that what he said
</p>

<p>
to me he said in it in confidence. And I have to respect
</p>

<p>
that, because I felt it was something he wanted to get off his
</p>

<p>
chest, and the reality of it is what he said to me, I had to
</p>

<p>
respect the confidentiality, but at the same time I wanted to
</p>

<p>
know, because up to that time there had been many rumors Anna
</p>

<p>
Mae had been spotted here and spotted there, there had been
</p>

<p>
many rumors around '75, '76, but nobody really knew what
</p>

<p>
happened. But when I talked to Arlo, it made it more concise
</p>

<p>
to me. I mean go to police, pragmatic, I mean no offense, but
</p>

<p>
my relationship with the United States government isn't a real
</p>

<p>
good one. I have no basis to be trusting police, I don't want
</p>

<p>
to be a pawn and be used against my own people. No, I don't
</p>

<p>
want that, and what if what is being said is a mistake. So I
</p>

<p>
can't just, yes. I wanted to know what happened to Anna Mae,
</p>

<p>
and I kept my agreement to Arlo until later when I see it in
</p>

<p>
the News From Indian Country these are the things that Arlo
</p>

<p>
has said, and somewhere because I wasn't the source of that
</p>

<p>
information, and then I knew alright, I can now publicly do
</p>

<p>
this.
</p>

<p>
Q. Let me ask you, based upon what you heard as you looked
</p>

<p>
in to Arlo's eyes as he was telling you these things, was it
</p>

<p>
your impression that he wanted her to die?
</p>

<p>
A. Was it my impression that what?
</p>

<p>
Q. Arlo wanted her to die based on what he said?
</p>

<p>
A. No.
</p>

<p>
Q. Was it your impression that he wanted to help see that
</p>

<p>
she died when he told you what had happened?
</p>

<p>
A. No, because he wouldn't have told me if he wanted those
</p>

<p>
things to happen, but those things did happen.
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: Thank you, sir. That's all.
</p>

<p>
REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. McMAHON:
</p>

<p>
Q. Mr. Trudell, you remember the fact that Mr. Looking
</p>

<p>
Cloud told you Anna Mae was begging for her life in the car?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, I do.
</p>

<p>
Q. You remember that?
</p>

<p>
A. I remember that.
</p>

<p>
Q. And you remember the fact that he was, she was begging
</p>

<p>
for her life all the while she was walking out to that cliff
</p>

<p>
with them?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes, I do.
</p>

<p>
Q. And she begged them not to kill her?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
Q. She talked about her two daughters?
</p>

<p>
A. She was saying what are her daughters going to do. See,
</p>

<p>
Anna Mae love her daughters very much, because the time I knew
</p>

<p>
her whatever went on in her family and her daughters, I knew
</p>

<p>
that was a very traumatic thing for her to not have her
</p>

<p>
daughters, so she talked about them, I mean before this. Her
</p>

<p>
daughters were a very focal point in her life, and that night
</p>

<p>
when they were walking her, yes, she was talking about her daughters.
</p>

<p>
Q. I think you said in response to a question by Mr. Rensch
</p>

<p>
that once they came out of that house on the Rosebud they were
</p>

<p>
under instructions to kill her?
</p>

<p>
A. Somebody was.
</p>

<p>
Q. And they went and did that?
</p>

<p>
A. Yes.
</p>

<p>
MR. McMAHON: That's all I have.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: Anything further?
</p>

<p>
RECROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. RENSCH:
</p>

<p>
Q. And Arlo told you that, that somebody gave instructions
</p>

<p>
for her to be killed?
</p>

<p>
A. I don't remember the exact words, alright, but they came
</p>

<p>
out of that house. John Boy, or Arlo told me John Boy and
</p>

<p>
Theda came out of that house and they drove from there and
</p>

<p>
took her out and walked her and killed her. Maybe he didn't
</p>

<p>
say the exact words you are trying to get me to say, but
</p>

<p>
basically he said that, because see, they weren't --
</p>

<p>
Q. Is it possible?
</p>

<p>
A. It's not something they thought up on their own.
</p>

<p>
Q. Is it possible what Arlo was describing to you was him
</p>

<p>
sitting out in the car, these two coming out of the house,
</p>

<p>
getting in the car, driving to a point, stopping the car, and
</p>

<p>
then this activity took place?
</p>

<p>
A. Say that again?
</p>

<p>
MR. RENSCH: Forget it, nothing further.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: Anything further?
</p>

<p>
MR. McMAHON: No, Your Honor.
</p>

<p>
THE COURT: Thank you, you may step down. We will
</p>

<p>
take our noon recess now, and I went a little longer because I
</p>

<p>
wanted the witness to be able to finish his testimony. So you
</p>

<p>
are excused, thank you. So we will be in recess until 1:30
</p>

<p>
this afternoon, thank you. Please stand for the jury.
</p>

<p>
(Recess at 12:20 until 1:30).

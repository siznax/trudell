The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee (2019) by David Treuer
_Native America From 1890 to the Present_
https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/oG-DDwAAQBAJ?hl=en

> In The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, Treuer melds history with
> reportage and memoir. Tracing the tribes' distinctive cultures from
> first contact, he explores how the depredations of each era spawned
> new modes of survival. The devastating seizures of land gave rise to
> increasingly sophisticated legal and political maneuvering that put
> the lie to the myth that Indians don't know or care about
> property. The forced assimilation of their children at
> government-run boarding schools incubated a unifying Native
> identity. Conscription in the US military and the pull of urban life
> brought Indians into the mainstream and modern times, even as it
> steered the emerging shape of self-rule and spawned a new generation
> of resistance. The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee is the essential,
> intimate story of a resilient people in a transformative era.

### Mission Dolores’ dark legacy for Indians: From salvation to subjugation and death

By Gary Kamiya

San Francsico Chronicle

2 November 2019

https://www.sfchronicle.com/chronicle_vault/article/Mission-Dolores-dark-legacy-for-Indians-From-14785648.php

Mission Dolores is by far the oldest and most historically significant
building in San Francisco. The white adobe church on Dolores Street
was once celebrated as a testament to the faith and courage of the
Spanish colonizers who built it — a reverential attitude enshrined in
the 1894 statue “Early Days,” which depicted a preaching priest
looming over a crouching Indian.


### _500 Years of Indigenous Resistance_

![alt](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hUWrO5AJL._SX313_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

1992 by Anonymous, The Anarchist Library

2002 by Gord Hill

An alternative and unorthodox view of the colonization of the Americas
by Europeans is offered in this concise history. Eurocentric studies
of the conquest of the Americas present colonization as a civilizing
force for good, and the native populations as primitive or
worse. Colonization is seen as a mutually beneficial process, in which
"civilization” was brought to the natives who in return shared their
land and cultures. The opposing historical camp views colonization as
a form of genocide in which the native populations were passive
victims overwhelmed by European military power. In this fresh
examination, an activist and historian of native descent argues that
the colonial powers met resistance from the indigenous inhabitants and
that these confrontations shaped the forms and extent of
colonialism. This account encompasses North and South America, the
development of nation-states, and the resurgence of indigenous
resistance in the post-World War II era.

lawmakers that work to advance our nation-to-nation relationships with
tribal governments and uphold our federal trust responsibilities to
Native Americans through the legislative process. The Caucus works on
a bipartisan basis to meet our nation’s moral and legal commitments to
American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians across a broad

housing, education, economic development, and cultural
preservation. As outlined in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution,
the caucus works to protect tribal sovereignty.

their representatives, and amplify the voices of Native Americans in
policy debates across all issues. Members are connected with experts
and leaders within Indian Country such as the National Congress of
American Indians for information on legislative proposals that impact
Native American tribes.

### Great Law of Peace (and the U.S. Constitution)

Some historians, including Donald Grinde of the University at Buffalo,
The State University of New York, have claimed that the democratic
ideals of the Gayanashagowa provided a significant inspiration to
Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and other framers of the
U.S. Constitution. They contend that the federal structure of the
U.S. constitution was influenced by the living example of the Iroquois
confederation, as were notions of individual liberty and the
separation of powers. [more...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Law_of_Peace#Influence_on_the_United_States_Constitution)

### Hempstead Project Heart

Founded by legendary Native poet, philosopher and recording artist
John Trudell, Hempstead Project HEART is a vehicle to build public
awareness of the many benefits of growing Industrial Hemp. With a team
of committed volunteers at his side, notably Anna Owen, Linda Delair
and Lea Walters, John built Hempstead Project HEART to be a driving
force to grow the hemp economy in America. From speaking at public
events to organizing with the California State Grange on Industrial

education and action in creating positive

In The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, Treuer melds history with
reportage and memoir. Tracing the tribes' distinctive cultures from
first contact, he explores how the depredations of each era spawned
new modes of survival. The devastating seizures of land gave rise to
increasingly sophisticated legal and political maneuvering that put
the lie to the myth that Indians don't know or care about
property. The forced assimilation of their children at
government-run boarding schools incubated a unifying Native
identity. Conscription in the US military and the pull of urban life
brought Indians into the mainstream and modern times, even as it
steered the emerging shape of self-rule and spawned a new generation
of resistance. The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee is the essential,
intimate story of a resilient people in a transformative era.

**David Treuer** is Ojibwe from the Leech Lake Reservation in northern
Minnesota. The author of four previous novels, most recently Prudence,
and two books of nonfiction, he has also written for The New York
Times, Los Angeles Times, Esquire, Slate, and The Washington Post,
among others. He has a Ph.D. in anthropology and teaches literature
and creative writing at the University of Southern California.

## Bibliographies

### A Critical Bibliography on North American Indians for K-12

This bibliography, compiled by the Anthropology Outreach Office of the
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, is a response to
these and other teachers' concerns about choosing culturally sensitive
and historically accurate books for children about American Indians
and Alaska Natives. Parents and the general public may also find it to
be a valuable resource for making informed choices about books. The
antibias guidelines and critiques found here can help readers develop
an ability to critically evaluate books and teaching curricula and
provide a foundation by which to assess the value of materials about
any culture or ethnic group.

As teachers and as parents, we are responsible for what and how we
teach our students and children. This publication can help guide
educators in becoming personally responsible for their own ethics of
education. Creating caring classroom communities that nurture the
human spirit regardless of ethnicity or other perceived differences is
the beginning step in building an educational environment that is
culturally sensitive to all students. Embrace our diversity, for it
truly is our greatest strength.

## Bibliographies

### A Critical Bibliography on North American Indians for K-12

This bibliography, compiled by the Anthropology Outreach Office of the
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, is a response to
these and other teachers' concerns about choosing culturally sensitive
and historically accurate books for children about American Indians
and Alaska Natives. Parents and the general public may also find it to
be a valuable resource for making informed choices about books. The
antibias guidelines and critiques found here can help readers develop
an ability to critically evaluate books and teaching curricula and
provide a foundation by which to assess the value of materials about
any culture or ethnic group.

As teachers and as parents, we are responsible for what and how we
teach our students and children. This publication can help guide
educators in becoming personally responsible for their own ethics of
education. Creating caring classroom communities that nurture the
human spirit regardless of ethnicity or other perceived differences is
the beginning step in building an educational environment that is
culturally sensitive to all students. Embrace our diversity, for it
truly is our greatest strength.

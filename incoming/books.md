By Ward Churchill

Foreword by John Trudell

Appendix by Russell Means and Ward Churchill


1992 · Common Courage Press · 

> "Not only the people of the land are being destroyed, but, more and
> more, the land itself. The nature of native resistance to the
> continued onslaught of the invading industrial culture is shaped
> accordingly. It is a resistance forged in the crucible of a struggle
> for survival." —from the introduction

As its foreword, the book features a poem by Jimmie Durham. The
preface is by Winona LaDuke and poems from John Trudell's Living in
Reality appear as preludes to each section. Russell Means' 1982
platform for president of the Oglala people is included as an
appendix. Maps of Indian land claims/treaty areas are included. The
book is dedicated "for my mother."

The collected essays, mostly previously published, provide a history
of Native American struggle for decolonization provided through the
examples of the Haudenosaunee in upstate New York, the Lakotas on the
northern Plains, the Lubicon Cree in northern Alberta, and the Navajo
and Newe (Western Shoshone) in the upper Sonoran. The case is made
that uranium mining, coal stripping, hydropower generation, and water
diversion are ecocidal as well as genocidal, and that the ecological
damage poses a threat to all North Americans.

Churchill also discusses the Native North American diaspora caused by
their displacement.

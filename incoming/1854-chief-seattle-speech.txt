Chief Seattle's speech is often cited, but people are still arguing
about its provenance. Most likely, the speech was made and overheard,
and it was powerful. Not having any document, its legend has
grown. Some consider his speech simply wise words from a tribal elder,
but others use the legend of the speech against each other by holding
it up as an environmental lament, or by pointing to it as propaganda
for religious and/or environmental causes.

> Chief Seattle's speech is one that Chief Seattle probably gave in

> The evolution of historic records of the speech, from a flowery

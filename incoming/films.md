_A Young Oglala Lakota Woman Faces a Difficult Decision_

In this excerpt from the Independent Lens documentary, Young Lakota,
Sunny Clifford describes the difficult decision she faces: whether to
remain on the Pine Ridge Reservation to help improve tribal conditions
or to leave to pursue opportunities elsewhere.

Aboout the Film

Three young people living in the Pine Ridge Reservation try to forge a
better future. When the first female President of Oglala Lakota defies
a South Dakota law criminalizing abortion by vowing to build a women's
clinic in their sovereign territory, the three young tribe members are
faced with difficult choices.

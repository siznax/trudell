https://www.sfchronicle.com/chronicle_vault/article/Mission-Dolores-dark-legacy-for-Indians-From-14785648.php

Mission Dolores is by far the oldest and most historically significant
building in San Francisco. The white adobe church on Dolores Street
was once celebrated as a testament to the faith and courage of the
Spanish colonizers who built it — a reverential attitude enshrined in
the 1894 statue “Early Days,” which depicted a preaching priest
looming over a crouching Indian.

faced with difficult choices.

### American Indian Cultural Center San Francisco

Since 1968, the purpose of the American Indian Center has been to
create a community space based on Native American values, culture,
programming, traditional foods, and community support.

The mission of the American Indian Cultural Center of San Francisco is
to improve and promote the well-being of the American Indian community
and to increase the visibility of American Indian cultures in an urban
setting in order to cultivate awareness, understanding and respect.

Our vision is to create and provide a dynamic place of learning,
cultural preservation, and community for the citizens of the bay area
to learn about American Indian heritage and culture, and to generate a
sense of understanding about American Indians in the urban
environment. 

https://www.aiccsf.org/

### American Indian Cultural District

The American Indian Cultural District of San Francisco is official! On
March 31st the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (BOS) voted
unanimously to pass the American Indian Cultural District
legislation. This is the first and only American Indian Cultural
District in the United States. While this will be a home to honor and
celebrate all Native American people, we would like to acknowledge and
thank our Ohlone relatives as we are guests on their traditional
lands.

### Congressional Native American Caucus

The Congressional Native American Caucus is a bipartisan coalition of
lawmakers that work to advance our nation-to-nation relationships with
tribal governments and uphold our federal trust responsibilities to
Native Americans through the legislative process. The Caucus works on
a bipartisan basis to meet our nation’s moral and legal commitments to
American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians across a broad
range of policy areas, including but not limited to health, safety,
housing, education, economic development, and cultural
preservation. As outlined in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution,
the caucus works to protect tribal sovereignty.  

Members work to maintain close relationships with tribal nations and
their representatives, and amplify the voices of Native Americans in
policy debates across all issues. Members are connected with experts
and leaders within Indian Country such as the National Congress of
American Indians for information on legislative proposals that impact
Native American tribes.

### Indian Rezervation Blues And More

2009 · Blues/Compilation

A unique project presenting the best Native American music from the US
and Canada of today : Blues, Country, Folk music, Traditional songs
and chants, Americana... even some R'n'B and Hip-Hop music, American
Indian style! 3 CDs - 3 hours of music - 30 minutes of video - 33
Artists - a 48-page booklet with an introduction by Pura Fe' (artist),
Elaine Bomberry (television producer) and Guy “The American” Fay
(talent scout). This 3-CD collection sets the record straight about
the reality of Indian music, highlighting its strong influence on
American music in general, and blues in particular. This set
introduces us to the “Real Indians” of today who express their
rebellion through hip-hop, performing highly original music that
carries traces of blues, rock and country. It is time to re-evaluate
the culture of the indigenous, “First Nations” people of North
America, and the influence they have had since the beginning of
American roots music.

### A Critical Bibliography on North American Indians for K-12

This bibliography, compiled by the Anthropology Outreach Office of the
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, is a response to
these and other teachers' concerns about choosing culturally sensitive
and historically accurate books for children about American Indians
and Alaska Natives. Parents and the general public may also find it to
be a valuable resource for making informed choices about books. The
antibias guidelines and critiques found here can help readers develop
an ability to critically evaluate books and teaching curricula and
provide a foundation by which to assess the value of materials about
any culture or ethnic group.

As teachers and as parents, we are responsible for what and how we
teach our students and children. This publication can help guide
educators in becoming personally responsible for their own ethics of
education. Creating caring classroom communities that nurture the
human spirit regardless of ethnicity or other perceived differences is
the beginning step in building an educational environment that is
culturally sensitive to all students. Embrace our diversity, for it
truly is our greatest strength.

### Uranium Mining

The Navajo People and Uranium Mining (2006) is a non-fiction book
edited by Doug Brugge, Timothy Benally, and Esther Yazzie-Lewis; it
uses oral histories to tell the stories of Navajo Nation families and
miners in the uranium mining industry. The foreword is written by
Stewart L. Udall, former U.S. Secretary of the Interior. 

The Navajo People and Uranium Mining has 12 chapters. Seven chapters
contain stories of the Navajo told through interviews of the miners or
their families. The remaining chapters describe the health effects
related to uranium mining, and "how these medical issues adversely
affected the lives of the miners and their families".

### Uranium mining and the Navajo people

In 1944, uranium mining under the U.S military's Manhattan Project
began on Navajo Nation lands and on Lakota Nation lands. On August 1,
1946, the responsibility for atomic science and technology was
transferred from the military to the United States Atomic Energy
Commission. Afterward, widespread uranium mining began on Navajo and
Lakota lands in a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union during the
Cold War.

### 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill

On August 5, 2015, the Animas and the San Juan River were affected by
the Gold King Mine spill in Colorado, when the EPA tried to drain the
water near the entrance of the mine. About 3 million gallons of water
seeped out in a blowout event. The contaminated water included iron,
lead, aluminum, zinc, and cadmium, and seeped into the Animas river,
eventually in the San Juan river. This spill affected the agriculture
of the Navajo people. The spill was an environmental disaster in the
region and came in the middle of growing season for hay and alfalfa.

The EPA takes responsibility for the spill, however they have not
provided any compensation to farmers who have been affected by this spill.

### 1979 Church Rock uranium mill spill

The Church Rock uranium mill spill occurred in the U.S. state of New
Mexico on July 16, 1979, when United Nuclear Corporation's tailings
disposal pond at its uranium mill in Church Rock breached its dam. The
accident remains the largest release of radioactive material in
U.S. history, having released more radioactivity than the Three Mile
Island accident four months earlier.

### The Return of Navajo Boy Webisodes

What happened after we released our award-winning documentary, The
Return of Navajo Boy about uranium contamination on native lands? The
short answer is, quite a bit. Groundswell Educational Films is
releasing a series of webisodes showing the effect that the
documentary has had on the lives of its participants, and how the film
is still being used today to affect change. You can watch them here in
chronological order, and order the film on DVD which contains our
epilogue.

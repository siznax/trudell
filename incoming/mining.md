Mining Reservations
===================

In 1985, according to the _Broken Rainbow_ documentary (00:07:15), on the Navajo
reservation alone lie:

1. 100 million barrels of oil
1. 25 trillion cubic feet of gas
1. 80 billion pounds of uranium
1. 50 billion tons of coal

"The energy corporations want the natural resources _under_ Indian
land, and if necessary, the native people will be sacrificed"

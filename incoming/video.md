Whiteclay, Nebraska is a tiny unincorporated town that sits on the
border with South Dakota. Until its closure by state officials, its
four liquor stores sold more than 4m cans of beer a year, almost
entirely to members of Lakota Sioux tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian
reservation, where the sale of alcohol is banned. The Guardian spent
time on the reservation to understand the impact of alcohol on its
residents – and the activists and Lakota tribe members determined to
keep the town closed

> There's a resource curse on the Navajo Nation. The

### Fast Horse

_This is Indian Relay, North America's original extreme sport_

### Sundance Winner | _Fast Horse_

Winner of the Short Film Special Jury Award for Directing at Sundance
2019: Alexandra Lazarowich

Take an intimate verité visit to a fascinating and little-known world:
the dangerous and high-stakes game of Indian Relay.

In Blackfoot country, they call Indian Relay “North America’s original
extreme sport.” Jockeys bareback gallop their horses around a track,
jumping off one and on to another in a chaotic melee of horses and
handlers at “the exchange”. Accidents happen. Simply finishing a race
demands masterful skill and courage.

Siksika horseman Allison RedCrow dreams of bringing a team to the
“greatest outdoor show on Earth” – the Calgary Stampede – so he and
his people can show the world their unparalleled skill on horseback.  

Our cameras follow Allison and his new jockey, Cody BigTobacco, over
the course of a year as they assemble a team of horses, train them for
the relay race and finally make their debut at the Calgary Stampede.
Their team, Old Sun, will face the best riders in the Blackfoot
Confederacy, many of them veteran competitors from Montana. Fast Horse
puts the audience on the back of a galloping horse, an exhilarating
POV experience that captures the thrill and risk of this white-knuckle
sport. 

But our cameras also capture the touching bond Cody and Allison have
with their horses. Witness, with intimate proximity, the committed
effort these majestic animals demand from their riders and
handlers. We see the horses accept their role and learn the complex
movements of the race.

And through this process, we come to understand and respect the skills
of horsemanship, which have been passed down for generations and
remain intact.

With a heart-pumping climax, experience the final race at the Calgary
Stampede from Cody’s own perspective. And just as promised, learn just
how unpredictable and dangerous the Indian Relay can be.

### Inside an Apache Rite of Passage into Womanhood

1 February 2018 · VICE Life · 11m

For the Mescalero Apache Tribe, girls are not recognized as women
until they have undergone the Sunrise Ceremony- an ancient,
coming-of-age ceremony that lasts for four days. Last May, VICE got
rare access to the ceremony for Julene Geronimo - the great, great
grand-daughter of the renowned Apache leader, Geronimo. We followed
Julene through each day of her arduous rite-of-passage to better
understand what womanhood means for the Apache tribe, and how these
ceremonies play a significant role in preserving a way of life that
almost became extinct.

### Chase a Wild Buffalo Stampede With These Heroic Cowboys

3 April 2017 · National Geographic Short Film Showcase · 15m

The bison—sometimes referred to as a buffalo—is a living symbol of the
American West. Despite once roaming the plains in numbers greater than
30 million, this iconic animal has recently come dangerously close to
extinction. By 1900, extensive hunting and fur trading had reduced
their population to less than one thousand. Although much progress has
been made over the past century, conservationists are still working
diligently to bring back the magnificent beast of the plains.

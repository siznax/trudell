### Four Directions

Different tribes interpret the Medicine Wheel differently. Each of the
Four Directions (East, South, West, and North) is typically
represented by a distinctive color, such as black, red, yellow, and
white, which for some stands for the human races. The Directions can
also represent:

* Stages of life: birth, youth, adult (or elder), death
* Seasons of the year: spring, summer, winter, fall
* Aspects of life: spiritual, emotional, intellectual, physical
* Elements of nature: fire (or sun), air, water, and earth
* Animals: Eagle, Bear, Wolf, Buffalo and many others
* Ceremonial plants: tobacco, sweet grass, sage, cedar

### Medicine Wheel

The Medicine Wheel, sometimes known as the Sacred Hoop, has been used
by generations of various Native American tribes for health and
healing. It embodies the Four Directions, as well as Father Sky,
Mother Earth, and Spirit Tree—all of which symbolize dimensions of
health and the cycles of life.

The Medicine Wheel can take many different forms. It can be an artwork
such as artifact or painting, or it can be a physical construction on
the land. Hundreds or even thousands of Medicine Wheels have been
built on Native lands in North America over the last several
centuries.

Movement in the Medicine Wheel and in Native American ceremonies is
circular, and typically in a clockwise, or “sun-wise” direction. This
helps to align with the forces of Nature, such as gravity and the
rising and setting of the Sun.

### How Hummingbird Got Fire (Ohlone)

Mount Umunhum gets its name from the Ohlone word for  “resting place
of the hummingbird.” Hummingbird is a central figure in the Ohlone
creation story and an important part of their culture. Valentin Lopez,
Chairman of the Amah-Mutsun Ohlone tribal band, reads the legend of
how Hummingbird got fire from the Badger People.  KQED Qwest video

### Seventh Generation (Lakota)

Black Elk, the Lakota holy man, predicted long ago that his people
would find new hope in the seventh generation. If his starting point
was the arrival of the white man in the mid 19th century, the seventh
generation is about at hand — and there is much reason for hope.

### Stickball

Stickball, a Native game that is the forerunner of lacrosse, can be
played by a large number of players, sometimes involving entire tribal
communities. It is especially popular among Southeastern Indians,
including the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. In stickball, both
teams must move the ball down the field using only their sticks—no
touching or throwing of the ball is allowed. Points are scored by
hitting the opposing team’s goal posts with the ball. The Choctaw hold
an annual World Stickball Championship as part of the Choctaw Indian
Fair.

A Good Relative
---------------

We practice, as we say in Indian Country, being “a good relative.”
Based on this principle, we pursue a spiritually directed organizing
strategy rooted in total awareness of the environment, past, and
future, and acting in harmony with all in the natural world and
humanity, in the present.

Animal Clans
------------

As our ancestors worked to fulfill their obligation to protect the
plants and animals of the land, they also studied their non-human
relatives for thousands of years.  The Bear Clans, Bird Clans,
etc. were given the responsibility to learn all they could about those
creatures.

Four Directions
---------------

Different tribes interpret the Medicine Wheel differently. Each of the
Four Directions (East, South, West, and North) is typically
represented by a distinctive color, such as black, red, yellow, and
white, which for some stands for the human races. The Directions can
also represent:

* Stages of life: birth, youth, adult (or elder), death
* Seasons of the year: spring, summer, winter, fall
* Aspects of life: spiritual, emotional, intellectual, physical
* Elements of nature: fire (or sun), air, water, and earth
* Animals: Eagle, Bear, Wolf, Buffalo and many others
* Ceremonial plants: tobacco, sweet grass, sage, cedar

### Great Law of Peace (Iroquois)

Some historians, including Donald Grinde of the University at Buffalo,
The State University of New York, have claimed that the democratic
ideals of the Gayanashagowa provided a significant inspiration to
Benjamin Franklin, James Madison and other framers of the
U.S. Constitution. They contend that the federal structure of the
U.S. constitution was influenced by the living example of the Iroquois
confederation, as were notions of individual liberty and the
separation of powers.

### Heyókȟa

Only those who have had visions of the thunder beings of the west can
act as heyokas. They have sacred power and they share some of this
with all the people, but they do it through funny actions. When a
vision comes from the thunder beings of the West, it comes with terror
like a thunder storm; but when the storm of vision has passed, the
world is greener and happier; for wherever the truth of vision comes
upon the world, it is like a rain. The world, you see, is happier
after the terror of the storm.— Black Elk

In Lakota mythology, Heyókȟa is also a spirit of thunder and
lightning. He is said to use the wind as sticks to beat the drum of
thunder. His emotions are portrayed opposite the norm; he laughs when
he is sad and cries when he is happy, cold makes him sweat and heat
makes him shiver. In art, he is depicted as having two horns, which
marks him as a hunting spirit.[6]. In some visions, he also appeared
as a snow bird, a swallow, a horse, a dog, a night hawk, a frog, or a
dragonfly.

### Ledger Art

Ledger art is a term for Plains Indian narrative drawing or painting
on paper or cloth. Ledger art flourished primarily from the 1860s to
the 1920s. A revival of ledger art began in the 1960s and 1970s. The
term comes from the accounting ledger books that were a common source
of paper for Plains Indians during the late 19th
century.

### Medicine Wheel

The Medicine Wheel, sometimes known as the Sacred Hoop, has been used
by generations of various Native American tribes for health and
healing. It embodies the Four Directions, as well as Father Sky,
Mother Earth, and Spirit Tree—all of which symbolize dimensions of
health and the cycles of life.

The Medicine Wheel can take many different forms. It can be an artwork
such as artifact or painting, or it can be a physical construction on
the land. Hundreds or even thousands of Medicine Wheels have been
built on Native lands in North America over the last several
centuries.

Movement in the Medicine Wheel and in Native American ceremonies is
circular, and typically in a clockwise, or “sun-wise” direction. This
helps to align with the forces of Nature, such as gravity and the
rising and setting of the Sun.

### How Hummingbird Got Fire (Ohlone)

Mount Umunhum gets its name from the Ohlone word for  “resting place
of the hummingbird.” Hummingbird is a central figure in the Ohlone
creation story and an important part of their culture. Valentin Lopez,
Chairman of the Amah-Mutsun Ohlone tribal band, reads the legend of
how Hummingbird got fire from the Badger People.  KQED Qwest video

### Sacred Stories

### Seventh Generation (Lakota)

Black Elk, the Lakota holy man, predicted long ago that his people
would find new hope in the seventh generation. If his starting point
was the arrival of the white man in the mid 19th century, the seventh
generation is about at hand — and there is much reason for hope.

### Stickball

Stickball, a Native game that is the forerunner of lacrosse, can be
played by a large number of players, sometimes involving entire tribal
communities. It is especially popular among Southeastern Indians,
including the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. In stickball, both
teams must move the ball down the field using only their sticks—no
touching or throwing of the ball is allowed. Points are scored by
hitting the opposing team’s goal posts with the ball. The Choctaw hold
an annual World Stickball Championship as part of the Choctaw Indian
Fair.

### Warrior

"Warriors are not what you think of as warriors. The warrior is not
someone who fights, because no one has the right to take another
life. The Warrior for us is one who sacrifices himself for the good of
others. 

His task is to take care of the elderly, the defenseless, those who
cannot provide for themselves, and above all the children, the future
of humanity."

—Sitting Bull

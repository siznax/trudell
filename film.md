Incident at Oglala (1992) Michael Apted
_The Leonard Peltier Story_
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incident_at_Oglala

> From the very beginning, Pelter's case has been dogged with
> controversy. Were the charged trumped up? Was the evidence
> falsified? Were witnesses pressured to change their testimony? Many
> people, including some of today's greatest legal minds, believe that
> Peltier is an innocent man. Twelve years ago, Robert Redford visited
> Leonard Peltier in prison. Today, after years of struggle with the
> FBI and the prison system, he and director Michael Apted (GORILLAS
> IN THE MIST, COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER) are able to present INCIDENT AT
> OGLALA- a riveting examination of the case and the real story of
> what may be one of the most outrageous abuses of justice in American
> history.

> Before the making of Thunderheart, Apted made the documentary
> Incident at Oglala about Leonard Peltier. Incident at Oglala then
> informed Thunderheart in the casting of actors for the fiction film.

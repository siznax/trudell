The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee (2019) by David Treuer
_Native America From 1890 to the Present_
https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/oG-DDwAAQBAJ?hl=en

> In The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, Treuer melds history with
> reportage and memoir. Tracing the tribes' distinctive cultures from
> first contact, he explores how the depredations of each era spawned
> new modes of survival. The devastating seizures of land gave rise to
> increasingly sophisticated legal and political maneuvering that put
> the lie to the myth that Indians don't know or care about
> property. The forced assimilation of their children at
> government-run boarding schools incubated a unifying Native
> identity. Conscription in the US military and the pull of urban life
> brought Indians into the mainstream and modern times, even as it
> steered the emerging shape of self-rule and spawned a new generation
> of resistance. The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee is the essential,
> intimate story of a resilient people in a transformative era.

https://www.google.com/books/edition/There_There/Dw83DwAAQBAJ

> There There is a wondrous and shattering portrait of an America few
> of us have ever seen. It’s “masterful . . . white-hot
> . . . devastating” (The Washington Post) at the same time as it is
> fierce, funny, suspenseful, thoroughly modern, and impossible to put
> down. Here is a voice we have never heard—a voice full of poetry and
> rage, exploding onto the page with urgency and force. Tommy Orange
> has written a stunning novel that grapples with a complex and
> painful history, with an inheritance of beauty and profound
> spirituality, and with a plague of addiction, abuse, and
> suicide. This is the book that everyone is talking about right now,
> and it’s destined to be a classic.

> There's a resource curse on the Navajo Nation. The
> 27,000-square-mile reservation straddling parts of Arizona, New
> Mexico, and Utah has an extremely high abundance of many energy
> resources — particularly coal. That coal is what's burned to provide
> much of the Southwest with electricity, and it creates jobs for the
> Navajo. But the mining and burning have also caused environmental
> degradation, serious health issues, and displacement.

> The only possible opening for a statement of this kind is that I

> of “legitimate” thinking; what is written has an importance that is
> denied the spoken. My culture, the Lakota culture, has an oral
> tradition, so I ordinarily reject writing. It is one of the white

The Ohlone Way (1978) Malcolm Margolin
_Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area_
https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Ohlone_Way/vapzCy2oVQoC

> Two hundred years ago, herds of elk and antelope dotted the hills of
> the San Francisco-Monterey Bay area. Grizzly bears lumbered down to
> the creeks to fish for silver salmon and steelhead trout. From vast
> marshlands geese, ducks, and other birds rose in thick clouds "with
> a sound like that of a hurricane." This land of "inexpressible
> fertility," as one early explorer described it, supported one of the
> densest Indian populations in all of North America.

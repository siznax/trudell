The Ohlone, formerly known as Costanoans (from Spanish costeño meaning
"coast dweller"), are a Native American people of the Northern
California coast. When Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in
the late 18th century, the Ohlone inhabited the area along the coast
from San Francisco Bay through Monterey Bay to the lower Salinas
Valley. At that time they spoke a variety of related languages. The
Ohlone languages make up a sub-family of the Utian language family.
Older proposals place Utian within the Penutian language phylum, while
newer proposals group it as Yok-Utian.

#### Contemporary Ohlone Groups

The Mutsun (of Hollister and Watsonville) and the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe
(of the San Francisco Bay Area) are among the surviving groups of
Ohlone today petitioning for tribal recognition. The Esselen Nation
also describes itself as Ohlone/Costanoan, although they historically
spoke both the southern Costanoan (Rumsien) and an entirely different
Hokan language Esselen.

Ohlone tribes with petitions for Federal Recognition pending with the
Bureau of Indian Affairs are:

##### Muwekma Ohlone

Members of the Muwekma Ohlone tribe attend a proclamation of the first

With 397 enrolled members in 2000, the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe comprises
"all of the known surviving Native American lineages aboriginal to the
San Francisco Bay region who trace their ancestry through the Missions
Dolores, Santa Clara and San Jose" and who descend from members of the
historic Federally Recognized Verona Band of Alameda County. On 21
September 2006, they received a favorable opinion from the
U.S. District in Washington, D.C., of their court case to expedite the
reaffirmation of the tribe as a federally recognized tribe. The
Advisory Council on California Indian Policy has assisted in their
case. They lost the case in 2011, and have filed an appeal.

### Ohlone

The Ohlone, formerly known as Costanoans (from Spanish coste√±o meaning
"coast dweller"), are a Native American people of the Northern
California coast. When Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in
the late 18th century, the Ohlone inhabited the area along the coast
from San Francisco Bay through Monterey Bay to the lower Salinas
Valley. At that time they spoke a variety of related languages. The
Ohlone languages make up a sub-family of the Utian language family.
Older proposals place Utian within the Penutian language phylum, while
newer proposals group it as Yok-Utian.

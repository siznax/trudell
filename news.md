The Native Seed Pod
-------------------

The Native Seed Pod is a podcast that explores and celebrates Native
Foodways, Ancestral Seeds, and the Traditional Ecological Knowledge
needed to renew the health of the Earth and all our relations. From
planting songs to cultural foodscapes, we highlight the importance of
protecting and restoring agrobiodiversity and food sovereignty to
sustain resilient communities.

We hope to serve as an antidote to the monoculture of the mind, by
asking the questions: what seeds have we inherited? What seeds have we
lost and are revitalizing? And what seeds are we planting to nourish
the future?

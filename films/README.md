### A Good Day To Die

![A Good Day To Die](mueller-salt-2011-good.jpg)

2011 · David Mueller, Lynn Salt · 1h 33m

A GOOD DAY TO DIE chronicles a movement that started a revolution and
inspired a nation. By recounting the life story of Dennis Banks, the
Native American who co-founded the American Indian Movement (AIM) in
1968 to advocate and protect the rights of American Indians, the film
provides an in-depth look at the history and issues surrounding AIM's
formation. From the forced assimilation of Native Americans within
boarding schools, to discrimination by law enforcement authorities, to
neglect by government officials responsible for the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, AIM sought redress for the many grievances that its people
harbored.

Banks' personal struggle culminated in major armed confrontations at
Custer, South Dakota and Wounded Knee -- climactic flash points which
saw him standing steadfast as a leader for his cause.

Bittersweet and compelling, A GOOD DAY TO DIE charts the rise and fall
of a movement that fought for the civil rights of American Indians.

### Incident at Oglala: The Leonard Peltier Story

![alt](https://zinnedproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IncidentOglala-261x400.jpg)

1992 ‧ Documentary/Political Drama ‧ 1h 30m · PG

Robert Redford narrates this documentary about the Pine Ridge Shootout
on an Oglala Sioux reservation in South Dakota. On June 26, 1975, two
FBI agents are searching for tribesman Leonard Peltier, wanted in
connection with an assault. They are killed after coming under heavy
fire, presumably from Peltier and his accomplices. However, proponents
claim that the FBI botched the investigation by tampering with and
suppressing evidence, and that Peltier's imprisonment is a miscarriage
of justice.

Michael Apted's documentary examines the 1975 slaying of two FBI
agents in Oglala, SD, which resulted in the arrest and conviction of
Native American activist Leonard Peltier for the murders. Making a
case for a retrial, Apted chronicles the tensions extant between the
U.S. government and the Oglala people since their occupation of
Wounded Knee in 1973 and examines the questionable circumstances
surrounding the investigation and subsequent trial of Peltier. The
film is a companion to Apted's own Thunderheart, which offers a
fictionalized account of the same case.

### Broken Rainbow

![Broken Rainbow](broken-rainbow.jpg)

1985 ‧ Documentary/History/Native Americans ‧ 1h 10m

In 1983, President Ronald Reagan's controversial Secretary of the
Interior James Watt sold coal leases on federal land in New Mexico and
Arizona to developers for exploration and mining. Thousands of members
of the Navajo tribe lived on this land, part of their ancestral
homeland, and were forcibly relocated away from their homes. This
documentary examines this and other injustices in the U.S./Navajo
relationship. Narrated by actor Martin Sheen, the film won a Best
Documentary Feature Oscar.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5z8OgMfXXc

1. In 1985 on the Navajo reservation alone lie (00:07:15):
    * 100 million barrels of oil
    * 25 trillion cubic feet of gas
    * 80 billion pounds of uranium
    * 50 billion tons of coal
1. "The energy corporations want the natural resources _under_ Indian
   land, and if necessary, the native people will be sacrificed"
   (00:07:29)
1. For 150,000 moons Indian prayers have bonded the earth and sky. The
   _Anasazi_, stargazers and architects of antiquity, designed the 
   blueprint for North America. The Hopi, descendants of the Anasazi,
   are the oldest living culture today. The word "hopi" means peace,
   and the Hopi have been people of peace for thousands of years. The
   Hopis are a pueblo people that lie at the center of "this disputed
   area", farmed plots close to the pueblo.
1. The _Hopi_ have **synchronized their energies to the rhythms of
   the universe**. "Seeing the world in Hopi eyes is seeing the world
   in balance." (00:10:20)
1. A thousand years ago, the _Navajo_ (or Diné), migrated into the
   southwest. According to their mythology, they came into existance
   through a circular hole called the "emergence place". They settled
   within the four sacred mountains with the Hopi at the
   center. (00:11:00)
1. The Navajo and Hopi believe they were put here to be caretakers of
   mother earth, and to protect the sacred center of the universe. The
   Navajo became **shepards** and believed the sheep are gifts from
   holy people. With the wool, they learned to **weave** rugs which
   became their primary source of income in the modern world.
1. The Navajo learned how to farm the desert from the Hopi, and
   **corn** became a part of their lives. With farming, the people
   became rooted and built permanent structures called **hogans**
   which open to the east, to greet the sun.
1. **Big Mountain, Arizona** is a shrine to the Navajo who built their
   homes around its base. For generations, land was handed down from
   **mother to daughter**. In 1985, **half the people were ordered to
   relocate** (00:14:00)
1. The Navajo elders know the properties of different **plants and
   herbs**, how to prepare them for different purposes, how to use
   **crystals and prayers** for healing, how to use **planets and
   stars** in planting. The elders don't care about money. They don't
   use new materials for houses and clothes because they know they
   won't last long.
1. "Washington" does not recognize these ways, he would think these
   things have no value but they are sacred to us. "Washington" says
   go walk among people and places you don't know. **"We are not hard
   enough to survive in places that are unfamiliar to us. We will
   grieve for our homeland, and it'll kill us."** (00:17:45)
1. "If they lose this, then they lose the thing that is the most
   precious to them, which we might call our soul." —**Jerry Kammer** 
   Journalist and Author. Kammer also points out that **they believe
   that if they leave their ancestral homeland, then they die in a
   way, and they can never return**. It kills them in a very real way
   to them.
1. "I don't know who these white people are. I hear they come from
   some place across the water and now they're telling everyone what
   to do." (00:18:41)
1. Colonel **Kit Carson** burned Navajo crops, slaughtered Navajo
   livestock, and murdered innocent people. (00:19:50)
1. **The Long Walk** and The Place of Suffering, Forced migration from
   Fort Defiance in eastern New Mexico to Fort Sumner in Arizona where
   they were interned, neglected and exposed to death.
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Walk_of_the_Navajo
1. 1/3 of the nation's strippable coal and 1/2 of its uranium is on
   Indian land.
1. A mormon lawyer named **John S. Boyden** wanted to strip mine the
   Hopi land. He held fraudulent elections in the Hopi villages and
   persuaded the BIA to appoint him attorney to the Hopi Tribal
   Council. The traditional Hopi lost control over their land and
   life.
1. **Peabody Coal** Col. Black Mesa Mine stripped 12 million a year
   from the Arizona plateau called Black Mesa. Black Mesa is a holy
   shrine to both Hopi and Navajo. Stripping her of her coal is as
   sacriligious as bulldozing St. Peter's Basilica for its
   marble. (00:36:10)
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mesa_Peabody_Coal_controversy
1. "300 Navajo families lost their homes and grazing lands when the
   [Peabody Coal] mine came in. They were neither consulted nor
   compensated. The pure air that once carried indian prayers to the
   heavens is now dense with lead, mercury dioxides, and sulphuric
   acids. Vast networks of power lines criss-cross their land. The
   indians call the transmission towers, White Man's Gods. **75% of
   the Navajo have no electricity themselves.** Vast quantities of
   water are used in the process of converting coal to electricity.
1. Interpreter for Traditinal Hopi Leaders, Thomas Canyacya says, we
   are facing a dangerous period ahead. If we do not stop, change, and
   correct some of these wrongdoings now, we are all going to
   suffer. Either things that we make will overtake us, or nature will
   take over; earthquake, flood, rain, severe drought, sever winter,
   lighting destruction, great wind destruction. These things will
   warn us that we are not following the law of The Great Spirit.
1. The U.S. Dept. of Interior disregarded the pleas of the elders, and
   urged tribal council memberss to sign leases that were
   substantially below market value: 0.4% of the value of their coal,
   1.3% of the value of their oil, 3.7% of the value of their uranium,
   and 1.8% of the value of their gas. (00:39:30)
1.

### The Trail of Tears: Cherokee Legacy

![]()

2006 ‧ Documentary ‧ 1h 55m

The 1838 Cherokee removal from the southeastern United States is
chronicled.

Narrated by James Earl Jones, "Trail of Tears: Cherokee Legacy"
explores one of the great historical tragedies of America's aboriginal
people. In 1830, eager to gain access to lands inhabited by Native
Americans, President Andrew Jackson enacted the Indian Removal Act
which forced the Cherokee Nation to leave their homeland and relocate
into unchartered territory. Many of these forced settlers suffered
from exposure, disease and starvation during the relocation. Nearly
one quarter of the Cherokee Nation died along the way.

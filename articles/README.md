### How A Native American Resistance Held Alcatraz for 18 Months

By David Treuer
The New York Times
21 November 2019

On Nov. 20, 1969, more than 70 Native Americans gathered before dawn
on a dock in San Francisco Bay. They boarded three boats and sailed
from the small, foggy harbor in Sausalito, Calif., to Alcatraz
Island. They intended to make landfall on territory belonging to the
United States government with the intent of claiming it for
themselves. Or reclaiming it, depending on your point of view.

He sat at the same table each evening, sometimes with lighting and
sometimes without, a cigarette often in hand, a guest always by his
side. In the background, the sound of waves rolling against the
rocks and the stuttering of a backup generator were constants. Then,
with a crackly yet true radio connection, streaming through the
wires from an unthinkable place — Alcatraz Island — he began
speaking in a calm, determined voice. The nation was listening.

Known for his peaceful opposition to unjust government policy towards
Indigenous people—and as someone who had a key role in every
significant event of his time having to do with equal rights for
Native Americans—John also advocated for the earth because “the
natural world has a right to existence and we are only a small part of
it.”

File shows the Bureau unwilling to investigate arson case that
claimed activist’s family. To mark the 49th anniversary this week of
the founding of the American Indian Movement (AIM), we’re taking a
look at the FBI file of John Trudell, esteemed Santee Dakota poet,
writer, speaker, and musician who was a key member of AIM, rising to
the rank of National Chairman by the mid seventies.

### Morbid transparency project opens the FBI files on the notably dead

Minnesota Star Tribune

For the past 16 months, when a notable person dies, Parker Higgins
sends a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Each letter
is the same, except for the name, and makes the same request: Hand
over the FBI file for the deceased. Higgins then posts the file
online, in its entirety, with a link to the obit. He calls it “FOIA
the Dead: a morbid transparency project.” Its icon is a little
pixilated skull.

### John Trudell Rose From Tragedy To Influence Generations

KCET Redefine

Most Californians familiar with the life and work of John Trudell,
who died December 8, will likely categorize his political work as
"Native Rights Activism." And that's not unreasonable: Trudell
identified first and foremost as an activist speaking out for the
rights of North America's original inhabitants. As a broadcaster, a
poet-musician, and the first Chairman of the American Indian
Movement, Trudell raised the profile of the grassroots Native Rights
movement.

### Hopi Black Mesa

Phoenix New Times

Thirty-one years ago, the Hopi Tribal Council struck an agreement to
sell groundwater to Peabody Western Coal Company. That water is
mixed with coal strip-mined by Peabody from nearby Hopi and Navajo
lands to make a slurry. The mixture is then injected into America's
only coal-slurry pipeline, which leads to a massive electricity
plant at Laughlin, Nevada, where the coal is burned to produce power
for Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix.

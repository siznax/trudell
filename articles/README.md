> Thirty-one years ago, the Hopi Tribal Council struck an agreement to
> sell groundwater to Peabody Western Coal Company. That water is
> mixed with coal strip-mined by Peabody from nearby Hopi and Navajo
> lands to make a slurry. The mixture is then injected into America's
> only coal-slurry pipeline, which leads to a massive electricity
> plant at Laughlin, Nevada, where the coal is burned to produce power
> for Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix.

> On Nov. 20, 1969, more than 70 Native Americans gathered before dawn
> on a dock in San Francisco Bay. They boarded three boats and sailed
> from the small, foggy harbor in Sausalito, Calif., to Alcatraz
> Island. They intended to make landfall on territory belonging to the
> United States government with the intent of claiming it for
> themselves. Or reclaiming it, depending on your point of view.

> He sat at the same table each evening, sometimes with lighting and
> sometimes without, a cigarette often in hand, a guest always by his
> side. In the background, the sound of waves rolling against the
> rocks and the stuttering of a backup generator were constants. Then,
> with a crackly yet true radio connection, streaming through the
> wires from an unthinkable place — Alcatraz Island — he began
> speaking in a calm, determined voice. The nation was listening.

> Most Californians familiar with the life and work of John Trudell,
> who died December 8, will likely categorize his political work as
> "Native Rights Activism." And that's not unreasonable: Trudell
> identified first and foremost as an activist speaking out for the
> rights of North America's original inhabitants. As a broadcaster, a
> poet-musician, and the first Chairman of the American Indian
> Movement, Trudell raised the profile of the grassroots Native Rights
> movement.
